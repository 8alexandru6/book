PROLOGUE
On an artificial island nestled in the vast Atlantic Ocean, strategically
positioned between Africa and South America, stands a remarkable modern
educational institution: The Richardson Elite Academy. The island's sheer
size is impressive, covering 8.7 square kilometers and bustling with 90,000
residents and 30,000 tourists, creating a vibrant hub where people from
around the world converge. Here, young minds come to shine, and the
brightest talents gather from all corners of the globe.
The Richardson Elite Academy is a learning utopia, a place where only the
best are chosen and nurtured to become future world leaders.
This exclusive institution offers a comprehensive curriculum, ensuring that
every student is well-prepared to excel in their respective fields, be it arts,
academics, or sports. It is the home of the most brilliant young minds.
Beneath the grand facade and prestige, however, lies a tale of intrigue and
competition.
In a large, immaculate white hall, fifty students are divided into two groups
of twenty-five each, and tension fills the air. The room is eerily silent, save
for the sound of shuffling feet on the immaculate floor.
Each of the fifty students is unique, with different appearances and
personalities. One side of the hall shows dazed students, struggling as if
faced with a complex riddle. The answer appears to elude them, leaving
them puzzled.
On the other side, confident students wear triumphant smiles, unnerving
their troubled peers. The outcome seems predetermined, favoring the
confident group.
Amidst this tense and uneven atmosphere, one exceptional individual stands
out. This observer watches quietly, a smile on their face, like a predator
enjoying the thrill of competition. Many may misinterpret their intentions,
given the gravity of the situation, but nobody truly understands this
mysterious figure.
Not even the observer themselves.

CHAPTER 1
FIRST CLASS
It has been apparent since ancient times that conflict is a natural byproduct of diverse groups of
people. Invariably, when you bring together individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives,
conflict is inevitable.

As sunlight bathed the white room, a swift finger silenced the blaring
alarm clock before it could fully ring. This morning was different—no
lingering snooze allowed. Inhaling deeply, the boy pondered for a moment,
his voice barely a whisper, "Today is finally here." He yawned and
stretched, as he got out of bed.
The fifteen-year-old boy sighed happily as he glanced across his room, his
jet-black hair swaying with every motion, while his bright blue eyes
sparkled under the sun's gaze. A radiant smile spread across his face as he
exclaimed, “Today is the day I’ve been waiting for!"
With an excited grin on his face, John leaped out of bed and launched into
his invigorating morning exercises. These exercises were a daily routine for
him, and he completed them in no time.
Taking a moment to absorb his surroundings, John surveyed his sparsely
furnished room. The room housed a bed, wardrobe, study desk, and chair.
Its traditional cooling system and large windows gave the room a cozy
atmosphere.

His eyes wandered to the three doors in his room, each leading to different
parts of his personal space. Yet today, only one door filled him with
excitement.
"Time to gear up. It's my first day of school!" he exclaimed, punching
his fist into the air.
As he readied himself, John felt a mixture of nervousness and excitement.
Months of anticipation now culminated on this day, and a twinge of unease
coursed through him.
Dressed and armed with his bright smile, John cast a final glance around his
room before venturing out. Closing the door behind him, a wave of
excitement washed over him. This day marked the beginning of a new
chapter in his life, and he couldn’t wait to see what it had in store for him.
With a skip in his step and his signature smile, John walked confidently out
of his room, eager for the adventure that awaited him.
______________________________________

In the vast, beautiful compound, an elderly man was jogging vigorously, his
body drenched in sweat despite the cool weather. It was just another day for
the sixty-seven-year-old, who was known to be a bit eccentric and
unconventional in his ways.
Standing silently in the compound, John watched his grandfather go
through his exercise routine, with a loving smile on his face.
“Grandfather is at it again, huh?” he mused fondly.
Dr. Matthew Lucien, the sweaty old man, was John's grandfather, and the
young boy watched him lovingly as he ran past.
Despite being sixty-seven, Dr. Lucien possessed a strikingly youthful and
handsome face and John couldn't help but think that no one would ever
believe he was a Ph.D. holder.
John wore his school uniform, an elegant and stylish outfit that perfectly
reflected the prestigious academy he attended. He wore a black blazer with
matching trousers, a crisp white shirt, and a royal blue tie, with the school's
golden badge proudly inscribed on the blazer, creating a nice contrast.

"Grandfather, I'm leaving!" John yelled to his oblivious grandfather,
who was so immersed in his workout, that he didn’t notice John calling out
to him.
Dr. Matthew Lucien slowed down almost instantly, snapping out of his
daze, and approached John. His entire body dripped with sweat, and his
breath was a little ragged, but a smile remained on his face.
"A-ah? How long have you been standing there?" he asked,
chuckling. "Didn’t see you at all until you called for me."
"It's not my fault that you're a fitness addict," John mumbled,
hiding a smile. His eyes suddenly popped wide open as he watched his
grandfather draw nearer. "H-hey! Don't come any closer. You reek!"
Dr. Lucien laughed heartily, patting John's head as he passed by. "It's the
smell of hard work, my boy. Remember that," he said.
John stared fondly at his grandfather, feeling a sense of pride and
admiration. He knew that Dr. Lucien had accomplished a great deal in his
life and that he had done so through hard work and determination.
It was a lesson that John could never forget.
______________________________________

"So, you're going to school already, huh? You have everything you
need?" Dr. Matt asked, in a seemingly casual tone, trying to hide his pride
and excitement in his grandson.
"Yeah!" John replied, beaming with confidence.
"You sure?" Dr. Matt persisted, wanting to make sure his grandson
was fully prepared.
John rolled his eyes again but couldn't help grinning. He knew his
grandfather meant well, even if he could be a little overprotective at times.
For a brief moment, they stood there in silence, taking in the moment. The
sky was clear and beautiful, the birds chirped happily, and it felt like
nothing else in the world mattered.

"Alright, then. Have fun at school. Do what you need to do." Dr.
Matt finally said, feeling a little lump in his throat as he spoke.
"Yeah!" John replied, eager to get going.
Without wasting another second, John darted off toward school. Dr. Matt
watched him go with a mixture of pride and sadness. His little grandson
was growing up so fast.
"This kid… he'll run out of breath too quickly," he whispered to
himself, chuckling softly.
As he resumed his jog, Dr. Matt's thoughts turned to his beloved grandson.
He may have been a little eccentric, but he was a good person at heart, and
there was nothing he wouldn't do for his family.
I hope you find what you’re searching for…

______________________________________

John's eyes widened in amazement as he took in the grandeur of the school
premises before him. The extensive compound spanned a massive twenty
acres of land, with numerous buildings and structures dotting the landscape.
It was like nothing he had ever seen before, and he couldn't help but feel a
sense of awe at the sheer size of it all.
As he approached the imposing gate, it automatically opened up, scanning
him to verify his identity before letting him in. John couldn't help but
marvel at the power of modern technology. It was impressive that there was
no need for any security personnel to verify his identity.
"Modern technology sure is nice," he muttered to himself, impressed
by the state-of-the-art technology.
As he made his way through the compound, one or two students brushed
past him, but they paid him no attention as they went about their business.
Glancing toward a particular student who seemed to be just as amazed as he
was, John felt a sense of kinship with the red-haired boy. They both took in
the amazing expanse of the campus grounds, marking their first time
attending such an amazing school.
If the boy hadn't checked his wristwatch, gasped, and quickly ran ahead,
John would have considered talking to him.
“A shame…” He whispered though he remained positive.
He would get the chance to meet more people, anyway. Besides, the boy
seemed to be about his age, so it wouldn’t be surprising if they ended up in
the same class.
“That would be nice,” John murmured, inhaling deeply.
The air was filled with the fresh scent of trees and the lovely aroma of
blossoming flowers. John couldn't help but smile wider with each step he
took. This was going to be an incredible experience.
Even though it was already 8:21 AM and classes commenced at 9:00 AM,
there was a general assembly scheduled thirty minutes before class. John
knew he couldn't be late, so he quickened his pace and headed towards the
main hall.

Spanning twenty acres, the entire school was so vast that walking or
running through it in just nine minutes was impossible. Yet, that didn't
worry him. The High School campus was a smaller section of the general
school compound, and a large chunk of the land was used for residential
and administrative facilities. He knew he could easily get to the main hall
and then head straight to class without any problems.
As he walked past the beautifully landscaped garden that surrounded him,
he couldn't help but feast his eyes on the beauty of the environment once
more. The school was truly breathtaking, and he felt a sense of excitement
and anticipation for what lay ahead in his new academic journey.
______________________________________

“I made it.”
John's heart raced with excitement as he stepped into the Main Hall at
precisely 8:30 a.m., the designated time for the general student assembly to
commence. As he gazed eagerly at the sea of identically dressed students in
their black blazers, blue ties, and shiny golden badges, he couldn't help but
feel a little nervous.
Despite the number of people present, the hall was completely silent, giving
off an intimidating and elite ambiance that slightly unnerved him.
As he made his way toward his assigned line, John couldn't help but admire
the immaculate appearance of his peers. They all looked elegant and
sophisticated, with their new uniforms and shiny shoes.
With the aid of signs that indicated where each group should stand, he
easily found his classmates huddled together in a tight group. However,
even without the indicators, he was confident he wouldn't have had any
trouble.
"Ah! That boy…" John's eyes caught sight of the boy with red hair, the
same one he had seen near the gate not too long ago. However, they were in
different lines.
"I guess we won't be in the same class, after all."
Still, that didn’t faze John in the slightest.

Just as he joined the line of about twenty students, a middle-aged man
stepped onto the stage and greeted everyone in a clear and confident voice.
"I am Charles Richardson, the founder and Principal of this school. It
brings me great pleasure to see you all gathered here for the start of a new
term, and I sincerely hope you have an enjoyable stay in this institute."
John watched everything—the way the principal's dark gray suit firmly
clung to his lean body, and even how his luxurious shoes were firmly
planted on the ground—with a smile on his face. However, his excitement
didn't stem from those things.
This was the first time John had ever heard an address like this in person. It
was his first time standing in line for a general assembly, the first time he
was attending an actual school.
The fact that he was right there was enough to make his heart race
uncontrollably.
“I see…” He spoke in a barely audible tone, watching as the man on the
podium continued.
“This academic institute accepts only three hundred and ninety
students per academic session and only fifty for High School. And so, I
would like to commend the new students for their grit and determination.
Amongst the millions who strived to get in, only you fifty have been
chosen.”
It sounded exaggerated, but it wasn’t. This wasn’t just your ordinary school,
after all.
“However, be reminded that this is only the beginning. As you already
know, getting in is one thing, but advancing to the next class is another ball
game entirely.”
It took four years to get through High School. Depending on their
performance, it was most likely that many of these students would not be
present by graduation.
"You have seen the prospectus and calendar, I’m sure. You undoubtedly
understand the busy year that awaits you. There will be a total of four terms
per session, each with two weeks of vacation in between. Each term will
have ten weeks of activity—tests, and examinations included."

Of course, the students were also told about how—for their summer break,
exclusively—six weeks were allocated, rather than the regular two weeks.
Needless to say, of the fifty-two weeks in a year, they would be spending
forty in High School.
A truly demanding and competitive environment.
“You must strive to be the best, to be exceptional in your various fields.
I expect nothing less from the geniuses of this generation.”
This was an academy with an acceptance rate of less than 0.1 percent of
applicants. A truly prestigious and extremely exclusive environment where
only the best thrived and the dregs were left behind.
John smiled. He knew all of this.
That was precisely why he had chosen to come here. It was his ideal
environment, filled with the best minds humanity could offer from all over
the globe.
It was the best High School in the world.
“Welcome once again to The Richardson Elite Academy. I do hope you
have a wonderful time.”

______________________________________

"Hey, everyone! I'm Matthias Archibald, your homeroom teacher for
this year."
With that simple introduction, the classroom came alive as an ordinarylooking man stood before them, dressed casually in a white t-shirt and black
trousers. Appearances could be deceiving, yet the students couldn't resist
being captivated by his confident smile and handsome face.
The classroom was arranged with precision, desks were neatly organized in
five rows and five columns. Each seat was perfectly comfortable and the
tables were fixed to the floor. No arguments or disputes would mar the first
day of school; where they sat now would be their designated seat for the
entire year.
"Welcome to Grade 9, Class B! Although technically, you're all freshmen
in high school," Mr. Matthias said in a relaxed and friendly tone that made
it seem like he had known them forever.
Teachers at elite schools were expected to be formal and rigid, but here was
Mr. Archibald, defying those stereotypes. He was downright chill with
everyone, and it was refreshing
"Since most of you are new here, let me explain a few things. Pay close
attention," he said, and the students eagerly complied.
"As you know, only fifty students are accepted into our prestigious high
school every year. Of those fifty, only twenty-five make it to Year 1. Age
doesn't matter in this citadel of learning; your acceptance and class
placement are based solely on your abilities, and so is your advancement to
the next class."
Silence filled the room, exactly the reaction Mr. Archibald had hoped for.
But he had more to share.
"You must have noticed the vastness of our campus and the comfort of
your dorms if you're staying in one. Our high school compound is a
collection of numerous buildings serving various purposes. The Main Hall,
where we were earlier, hosts general assemblies. Lectures take place in the
Central Building, which includes this very classroom."
Guided here after the assembly, the students had already glimpsed the
wonders Mr. Archibald described. But it was reassuring to have someone

explain and solidify their experiences.
"Besides the Central Building, we have a range of facilities on this
campus. Sports fields and courts, buildings dedicated to arts, music, crafts,
and more. This school embraces and supports all your talents and abilities,
whatever they may be. It's an all-inclusive place."
One couldn't help but wonder how much funds had gone into establishing
such a remarkable school. How much would tuition cost? How many could
afford such an incredible opportunity? But here's the most amazing part—
they didn't have to pay a dime!
"You're all here because of your abilities, nothing more. This academy
has generous sponsors, and our stakeholders provide abundant financial
support to ensure you receive the best education.” The excitement radiating
from Mr. Matthias's smile was infectious, filling the students' hearts with
immense joy.
Truly, this was a paradise they had stepped into.
Yes, it was a given that they had to put in the work, but as long as they did
all that, they were guaranteed an amazing time. Besides, they were
geniuses, weren’t they?
"Guess what? Each one of you will receive an allowance! Your Student
Identification Cards can also be used as a currency across the campus,
giving you access to all the facilities. And here's a little extra motivation—
the top five performers in each class will receive bonuses. But don't worry,
we'll start assessing that when the time is right. Just thought you should
know," Mr. Matthias revealed, adding another layer of excitement to the
mix.
The atmosphere in the classroom was electrifying. The students not only
loved what Mr. Matthias said but also how he said it. Whispers of
excitement filled the air, painting a vibrant and lively picture.
Mr. Matthias didn't try to quiet the enthusiastic chuckles and murmurs. He
knew teenagers would be teenagers, especially on their first day of high
school. So, he simply smiled, paused, and after a moment, continued.
He delved into all the amazing things the academy had to offer. The best
academics, state-of-the-art facilities for every course, highly qualified and

specialized staff, an amazing and safe environment, healthy competition,
strict but beneficial rules, the dedicated student council, and the freedom to
explore a wide range of extracurricular activities.
Everything was presented in a concise yet compelling manner, drawing
positive remarks from the students. Even the list of do's and don'ts felt
reasonable. Who wouldn't agree that cheating, stalking, or loitering had no
place in a well-ordered society?
It all fit together seamlessly, creating a tapestry of possibilities that left the
students brimming with excitement and anticipation.
______________________________________

Minutes had gone by since Mr. Archibald began engaging with the class,
effortlessly delivering a wealth of information without missing a beat. His
relaxed smile, composed demeanor, and minimal gestures allowed him to
captivate the students' attention, keeping them enthralled with his words.
"He's impressive," John murmured under his breath, caught off
guard by the teacher's skillful presentation.
Talking to himself was a habit John had developed as a child, a result of
limited social interaction or perhaps his unconventional upbringing.
Nevertheless, he realized he had to curb this tendency in a normal social
environment.
"I can't let them think I'm weird. Ah, I’m doing it again," John
scolded himself, struggling to suppress his inner dialogue. Wincing at the
sound of his voice, he nervously scanned the classroom.
Maybe no one saw him after all.
Well, it shouldn't be too much of an issue. His voice was barely audible at
this point, unlikely to disturb anyone. Moreover, the considerable distance
between the students' seats, roughly a meter apart, ensured that his barely
audible voice wouldn't travel far.
"Alright, I'll be leaving you all now. Enjoy a ten-minute break before
your first period. Use the time wisely," Mr. Archibald's vague farewell
echoed through the room.

"Have a great day," the teacher concluded, swiftly exiting the room
and closing the door behind him.
“…”
Silence fell upon the classroom the moment Mr. Archibald left, creating a
lot of awkwardness. What did they expect? Every person in that room was a
stranger.
"Hmm… this sucks" John glanced to his left, a fleeting thought
crossing his mind.
Contrary to his intentions, the stifling atmosphere intensified. It wasn't that
he hadn't experienced such a quiet environment before; in fact, being
homeschooled up to this point made him all too familiar with it.
Amidst the prolonged silence, however, something caught his attention,
despite his attempt to remain composed.
"I wanted to sit by the window..." He sighed.
Instead, John found himself occupying an ordinary seat in the third row and
fourth column—not exactly a coveted spot. He had known the chances of
getting a seat by the window were slim, but the outcome still left a bitter
taste. To make matters worse, the day wasn't unfolding as he had hoped.
"When you're dissatisfied, set a goal and work towards it," John
recited his mantra, making a decision. Rather than sulking like a loser, he
resolved to take action. Perhaps this was his opportunity to make a good
impression on his classmates and score social points.
If he was lucky, he could become the Class Representative and draw a
crowd of admirers. His popularity could skyrocket from there, and it wasn't
a bad idea at all. His heart raced with anticipation as he formulated the
perfect plan in his mind.
"Alright, let's—" He started.
"Excuse me, everyone. May I have your attention?" A beautiful
girl suddenly rose from her seat, a split second before John could make his
move. The moment her melodious voice reached his ears, he felt as if his
body was glued to the chair, rendering him immobile.

Thankfully, his head could still turn, so he mechanically shifted his gaze
toward the captivating girl. Her seat was also positioned in the third row,
right beside the line of windows that offered an amazing view of the
enchanting surroundings beyond the classroom.
John couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy.
With her long brown hair and mesmerizing violet eyes, she commanded his
full attention. She was a total stunner, lighting up the room with her
dazzling smile. One glance at her was enough to take anyone's breath away.
Dressed in a neatly fitted uniform, her skirt gently swayed as she addressed
the audience, capturing the gaze of most, save for a couple of distracted
students.
"I’ll get straight to the point. These ten minutes we've been given
will likely shape the course of our lives here. I suggest we put this time to
good use." Her serious tone matched the expression on her face.
"Elaborate." A boy sitting beside her promptly responded.
Behind his glasses, his eyes remained fixed on the book on his desk, yet his
sharp reply revealed that he was listening to her every word.
"Firstly, I'd like to ask a question. How many of us here graduated
from this Academy's Middle School?"
The Richardson Elite Academy, as an academic institution, included a
Middle School program spanning two years. Upon completion, deserving
students were promoted to the High School level.
Based on this fact, a couple of students in the classroom had to be from the
incoming set.
However—
“Nobody, huh?”
No one raised their hands. Not even one.
“It seems I was right.” A hint of concern crept into her voice,
casting a shadow over her once vibrant demeanor. The bright violet hue in
her eyes dulled as if reflecting the gravity of the situation.
“Elaborate.” Once more, the boy beside her said.

At this moment, tension gripped most of the students. Everyone wanted to
hear what the standing girl had to say. However, the knowing expressions
on several faces suggested that they were reaching the same conclusion as
the girl addressing them
“Only twenty-five students graduated from the Middle School during
the last session. As first years, the school split new entrants into two evenly
divided classes. That means only one thing.”
Whispers rippled through the room as more and more students pieced
together the puzzle, their eyes widening with dawning comprehension.
"It means that those who have been educated here before, who
survived the rigors of this prestigious academy, have been placed in Class
A," the girl continued, her voice carrying a mix of resignation and
determination. "That leaves us, the newcomers, in Class B."
The realization settled heavily upon the perceptive minds in the room. The
girl forged ahead, her voice steady and filled with conviction.
“Do you know what that means?” Some may have pieced it
together, but it was still a hard pill to swallow. Nevertheless, it needed to be
said.
“From the very beginning, we've already started competing.”
In Richardson Elite Academy, competition was everything, a driving force
that propelled students to surpass their limits. The elite nature of the school
demanded nothing less.
There was just one problem, though.
“We’re on the losing end!”
______________________________________

“I understand now. So that's how it works.” John chuckled inwardly. This
school had lived up to his expectations.
“They've grouped the returnees in one class, and us newcomers in another.”
As Charlotte raised the point that had eluded most of the students, the true
intentions of Richardson Elite Academy became glaringly obvious. The

classroom's already tense atmosphere took another hit as the devastating
truth sank in.
Why would the school take such a drastic step so early? What was their
ultimate goal? John's heart raced as he pondered these questions. The more
he surveyed the room, the more his anxiety grew.
"If I may, I'd like everyone to listen to what I have to say. We
shouldn't feel trapped in this situation," she urged.
John's eyes lit up as he listened to the brunette's awesome speech. Her
social skills were incredible, and she was so charming. Almost everyone in
the class was hooked, hanging onto her every word.
"As Mr. Archibald emphasized in his address, a point our principal
reiterated in his opening speech, this school thrives on competition. This
setup embodies that agenda," she said. speaking with eloquence and
passion.
According to her, this was a battle between the returnees and the newbies—
the students who had attended the school's prestigious middle school versus
those who came from other schools. It was clear to anyone with common
sense who would come out on top.
"Yes, they have the advantage of being at Richardson Elite
Academy longer than us. They possess greater knowledge of how things
work here and are likely more skilled. However..." Her voice resonated with
passion as she poured her heart out. "...that doesn't guarantee their victory!"
Her words were instantly met with skeptical looks.
Thus far, she had done well. But without solid evidence to back up her
claim, the students could easily resign themselves to their fate as inferior
students from inferior schools.
"Richardson Elite Academy prioritizes the growth of all its
students and ensures fairness. I don't believe they would show bias by
giving one class an advantage over the other. The scales must be evenly
balanced."
Even though she didn't have all the details to fully convince everyone, what
she said still managed to ease their worries. She had a point, and it made
sense.

"We just need to approach this situation calmly and prepare
accordingly. There might be group exercises where we'll have to work
together. So, it's crucial that we quickly familiarize ourselves with one
another. That way, Year 1A won't have the upper hand."
Her suggestion sounded like an awesome idea to everyone, and the way she
effortlessly got her message across to the whole class showed just how
brilliant she was.
"As I said, it’s important for us to get along with each other. We can do
this by introducing ourselves. I'm Charlotte and I’m delighted to meet all of
you. Let's forge strong connections." With a radiant smile and her right
hand placed over her heart, Charlotte greeted everyone.
At that moment, the atmosphere in the class shifted, and her intervention
marked the first move Year 1B took as a united group—class introductions.
______________________________________

Anticipation crackled in the air as the students gathered in the classroom,
their faces a mix of nervousness and excitement. Time was limited, so there
was no room for lengthy introductions, but each class member rose from
their seats, eager to make a good impression.
Amid their shared apprehension and social anxiety, not a single objection
was heard. The weight of the unknown pressed upon them all, and it was
Charlotte, with her quick thinking, who offered a sensible solution.
“My name is Ben Elias. A pleasure to meet you all.” The first to
break the ice was a strikingly handsome young man.
His dark brown hair framed a face that oozed both seriousness and
magnetism, captivating the attention of those around him.
The introductions continued haphazardly, devoid of any specific order.
Energetically, a girl named Sofia Venla leaped from her seat, addressing the
class with vibrant enthusiasm.
"Let's all get along!" she exclaimed, her words serving as an
invitation for teamwork and friendship.

With confidence radiating from his tall, well-built frame, Oliver Logan rose
next. A charming smile graced his lips as he introduced himself.
"Pleasure to make your acquaintance."
Before Oliver could fully settle back into his seat, another student got up,
intentionally showcasing his wild, white hair as he grinned mischievously.
"I am Gabriel Lucas," he declared, his voice brimming with
confidence. "A brilliant and gifted young mind from France. It is my
pleasure to be among such esteemed peers, though I hope none shall hinder
my pursuit of excellence as we navigate through this..."
Gabriel's self-centered monologue continued painfully until it was abruptly
cut short by Christopher Hitchens, who stood up with warmth emanating
from his smile.
"I'm Christopher Hitchens. Delighted to meet you all," he
interjected, putting an end to Gabriel's ramblings.
A tense exchange of glares passed between Gabriel and Christopher before
the introductions resumed. One after another, students stood and shared
their names, their personalities shining through their brief words.
Leonardo Lorenzo, a vivacious young boy, greeted the class with
contagious enthusiasm.
Alisa Viktoriya, on the other hand, seemed tired, her voice barely audible as
she introduced herself before laying her head on her desk.
Mikail Rufus, an exuberant and chubby ebony boy, couldn't contain his
excitement. Grinning from ear to ear, he implored the class, "Let's do our
best to defeat Year 1A!" His enthusiasm was contagious, fueling a spark of
determination within the room.
Yusuf Omer, with his warm smile and dark complexion, greeted his
classmates, radiating an aura of peace.
Lolade Oladeinde, a dark-skinned girl whose eyes shimmered with
mischief, maintained her lovely smile as she spoke, her excitement
apparent.
"Daisuke. Daisuke Aizawa" proclaimed a serious-faced boy who rose,
bowed, and swiftly returned to his seat. His formal introduction left a

lingering air of mystery.
Sung Han Soo, who seemed too young for high school, scarcely
acknowledged the proceedings. Engrossed in his smartphone, he mumbled
his name, barely looking up.
Although not as dull as Sung Han Soo's introduction, Ida's shy voice
resonated softly in the room.
"I'm Ida Sofia. It's a pleasure to be among like-minded individuals,"
she stated with a slight blush on her plump cheeks.
Breaking the tension with an enthusiasm that bordered on hysteria, Lara
Jacobs announced herself. "Lara Jacobs is my name, and living healthy is
my game!"
As one would expect, her statement hung awkwardly in the air and met with
a mixed reaction. She sensed the disconnect and gracefully retreated to her
seat.
The classroom held its breath as the introductions neared completion; the
anticipation mounting with each passing second. Finally, another girl
mustered the courage to rise from her seat. Her voice had a captivating
melody as she introduced herself.
"I'm Marie Felix," she stated before gracefully settling back into her
chair.
Ali Aeden, a student with a slightly rough tone and a darker complexion,
followed suit. With a humble smile and a hint of awkwardness, he
expressed his hopes for a fruitful learning experience before returning to his
seat.
A stunning girl stepped forward, her beauty shining through even in her
generic school uniform. Her flawless face and enchanting smile were
captivating.
"I'm Alicia Beatriz. A pleasure to be here," she said with a playful
wink that could set hearts on fire.
The next girl, Joana Isabel, closed her eyes as she introduced herself, her
words delivered with haste before she fell into silence. It was a brief but
hilarious encounter.

Grace Ellie, an intelligent-looking girl, stepped forward, expressing her
desire to forge friendships with everyone present. Her words carried a sense
of sincerity and warmth.
“Sup. I’m Klaus Gerard.” Confidence exuded from a handsome young
man who introduced himself with a charismatic smile.
He allowed the room to fully absorb his presence before gracefully
retreating to his seat, leaving a lasting impression.
With only a few students remaining, the class eagerly glanced around for
the next person to speak. John, tapping his desk anxiously, had been
patiently waiting for his turn. He murmured shakily, as he tried to soothe his
anxiety.
Other students had interrupted his attempts to stand and introduce himself,
but now, his moment had finally arrived.
‘I can do this. I can do this,’ John reassured himself, his heart racing with a
mix of excitement and fear.
He struggled to hide his flustered expression, determined to stay composed.
This was all new to him, his first time experiencing something like this.
Taking a deep breath, he addressed the class with a smile.
"Good morning, everyone. My name is John Lenard. It's a pleasure to
meet all of you."
With those ordinary words, he retreated to his seat, his smile unwavering.
He had achieved his goal, and despite his racing heart, he couldn't help but
feel a sense of satisfaction.
"I nailed it!" John silently celebrated, giving himself an internal fist
bump.
The attention directed at him was thrilling, proof that he could overcome his
social awkwardness. This experience had challenged him, but he came out
victorious.
Yes! This was a complete success for him.
The introductions continued, next up was a lifeless greeting from a person
who seemed even more drained than Viktoriya, the girl who spoke earlier.

"Hey... Anne Rowena here," she murmured, her lack of interest
evident on her weary face.
John couldn't shake the feeling that she had no desire to be here, evident in
her lazy response to the class bonding exercise.
Next up was Noah Louis, the boy sitting beside Charlotte, who finally
gathered the courage to introduce himself. As he spoke, his glasses seemed
to dance, adding a quirky charm to his persona.
At this point, all eyes turned to the blond girl seated in the front row, who
had been silently observing as others spoke.
Her beauty was ethereal, even rivaling Charlotte's, yet there was an aura of
regal elegance about her.
Her presence was a mystery, impossible to unravel, as her radiant eyes
captivated anyone who dared to look at her. It was as though she were a
predator, drawing everyone in with her intense gaze, ready to strike.
Now, she was the only one who had not revealed her name, and the room
held its breath.
"Good morning, everyone," she began in a delicate voice, her gaze
sweeping the room, making eye contact with each individual. There was an
uncanny depth to her eyes as if she could peer into the very depths of their
souls.
John's heart skipped a beat when she smiled at him.
"I am Mia Elena. I sincerely hope we can all foster strong bonds.
Thank you for your time."
Her brief statement contained hidden intentions that intrigued John.
Perhaps it was just his imagination, he thought, dismissing the complexity
he sensed.
Instead of dwelling on Mia's words, John turned his attention to the girl
who had set everything in motion—Charlotte Olivia.
He couldn't help but admire her smooth social skills and natural leadership.
In just moments, she had organized the introductions for the entire class.
Her quick thinking and infectious enthusiasm only piqued his curiosity even
more.

“Someone like her would make an excellent Class Representative,” he
mused.
However…
She’s too naïve.
He let out a soft sigh, his attention drawn to her excited smile and the
evident satisfaction in her facial expression, a clear sign of her delight in
everyone's cooperation.
Why does she seem so pleased with herself for bringing everyone together
and identifying the problem, when it's such a basic move? Professor
Charles Richardson and Mr. Matthias Archibald already gave us enough
clues, so this much is expected.
Also…
He shifted his gaze from Charlotte to the rest of the class.
Why had no one initially discerned the division between 1A and 1B? Why
were they shocked when she brought it up? Did they not grasp the
implications of why we are here? Could it be that they were hiding their
knowledge?
If that were the case, it would be disappointing.
Moreover, Charlotte mentioned "figuring it out together" when addressing
the unbiased reasoning behind the deliberate class division.
What is there to figure out? Can’t they see it? Is it just me?
These questions swirled in his mind.
Naturally, anyone with even a bit of intelligence would assume Year 1A had
an advantage over 1B. Richardson Elite Academy was renowned worldwide
for its top-notch education. The 1A students had been in this environment
longer, making it seem obvious they would excel.
But the true answer lay far from such superficial notions.
They must have been in different classes during middle school, so now that
they have all graduated, they find themselves placed in the same high
school class. It's clear that back then, they were forced to compete against

each other, and it is far-fetched to assume that the intensity of that rivalry
will suddenly disappear now that they're together again.
Merging several conflicting factions into one cohesive team wouldn’t
automatically make them efficient. The animosity and fierce competition
was still going to linger, and it would take a skilled leader to unite them,
someone far superior to Charlotte and her basic attempts.
Moreover, their previous knowledge and preconceived notions from middle
school probably won't apply anymore.
The fact that all the campuses within Richardson Elite Academy were
separate meant that even the returning students would be facing new
challenges and a different system.
Their past experiences will become obsolete.
Besides, didn't Mr. Archibald already provide them with general
information about the high school, including rules and facilities? They were
all given the school's prospectus as well. So, objectively speaking, did Year
1B really lack any necessary information?
While Year 1A is burdened with unresolved rivalries, our group is meant to
bond and function efficiently. This levels the playing field considerably.
From an intellectual perspective, it might appear that 1A had an advantage,
but John didn't see it as an issue. Student abilities naturally differ.
Furthermore, the school's decision to offer similar classes for both Year 1A
and 1B, fostering healthy competition, emphasized the fairness of the
educational system.
John pondered over numerous other factors swirling in his mind. Still, he
couldn't help but wonder if he was the only one with these thoughts.
That can't be true, right? I’ll try not to assume anything and just observe
quietly. He told himself.
To be fair, since he was silent, there were likely others who shared his
views but chose to remain silent as well.
As the introductions were wrapping up, Charlotte was probably going to
speak again.
For now, I'll go along with this. But… John whispered to himself.

Yet, a glint sparked in his eyes as he stared not at the girl but at something
right behind her. There stood an object, captivating his attention and
diverting his focus from the confusing first impressions of his classmates.
"I really want that seat," John sighed, his face deflating.
But just as quickly as he sighed, he pushed aside his gloomy thoughts. It
was his first day of school, and he knew he had to play his part well.
If he revealed too much of himself, his chances of achieving his goal would
reduce drastically. Perhaps he was simply ignorant, and by immersing
himself in this new environment, he could gain a deeper understanding of
those around him.
That’s why I chose this school, after all.
______________________________________

"Attention, everyone. Time's up," announced the homeroom teacher
as he walked into the classroom, punctual to the second.
Precisely at 9:00 AM, the students' eager eyes locked onto Charlotte, only
to find themselves staring at the enigmatic figure of Mr. Archibald.
He wasn't who they had anticipated, not by a long shot.
"Now, if you direct your attention to the right end side of your desks,
you'll notice a discreet button. Press it, and a compartment will open up
under your desks. You’ll find a few items within; headphones, a notebook,
two pens, and a few other items. More importantly, though, you’ll find a
smart tablet. " Mr. Archibald's voice echoed through the room.
Curiosity mingled with hesitation as the students awkwardly obeyed,
pressing the hidden buttons, unsure of what awaited them.
What happened next shook the entire class to its core. Mr. Archibald's next
statement pierced the silence, leaving everyone baffled and on edge. The
warmth of his smile had vanished, replaced by an almost robotic tone.
"In just a few seconds, your devices will turn on, and a survey sheet
will materialize before you. Your task? In three minutes, type out the names
of each one of your classmates," his words hung in the air, heavy with a
sense of gravity.

The students gasped in confusion, struggling to comprehend the sudden
shift in their teacher's demeanor.
The room buzzed with uncertainty.
"U-UH—?" stammered one student, their voice trembling with disbelief.
Mr. Archibald seemed unbothered by the bewildered expressions that now
adorned his students' faces. His face was resolute, and his stern expression
left no room for doubt—this was no joke.
In an instant, a wave of urgency surged through the room.
Students rifled through their lockers, frantically searching for the tools
needed to tackle the unusual task assigned to them. There was no time to
question or ponder the reasons behind the teacher’s task. Action was their
only choice.
To recall and pen down the names of twenty-four strangers in a mere three
minutes—such was the daunting challenge set before them. Hearts raced
and hands trembled as they hastily embarked on their challenging task.
And with a single command, Mr. Archibald's stern voice rang out, marking
the beginning of their race against the clock.
"... Your time starts now."

CHAPTER 2
DOMAIN OF THOUGHT

Within every person lies a labyrinthine heart, so dark and complex that even the devil himself cannot
unravel its mysteries.
______________________________________

The classroom was suffocating, enveloped in an uncomfortable silence
that hung heavy in the air.
All twenty-five students remained poised, completely still, acutely aware of
their homeroom teacher's watchful gaze. Quickly, their hands moved with
urgency, their minds racing to recall and input as many names as possible
into their tablets.
A mix of emotions – anxiety, surprise, confusion, and uncertainty – hung in
the air, thickening the atmosphere with palpable tension. And then, as
though synchronized to the ticking of a clock, the moment arrived.
"Time's up."
Like a choreographed routine, every tablet powered down, its timer
signaling the end of the test.
"Don't worry. Everything you entered has been recorded," Mr.
Matthias Archibald reassured, his casual smile returning to his lips.
Unsurprisingly, most students did not reciprocate that smile. Their thoughts
undoubtedly dwelled on the sudden exercise imposed upon them and the
question of how they would fare. Yet, amidst the sea of twenty-five
individuals seated there, a few appeared unfazed by the exercise.
John was one of them.
"As expected..." he murmured, his voice barely audible.
In truth, the moment he took his assigned seat, he had already anticipated
the unfolding events.
Years of practice had sharpened his ability to observe. As he took his seat in
the classroom, his keen eyes quickly spotted a button on his desk, and

without drawing attention, he discovered the concealed tablet, as well as the
other items hidden alongside it.
I suspected that something like this would happen.
Naturally, John hadn't anticipated that the exercise would entail
remembering all his classmates' names, at least not right away. But as their
homeroom teacher began his opening speech and granted them a ten-minute
window for interaction, the pieces of the puzzle started to align.
“We'll probably be given a brief window to enter all our classmates'
names,” he had figured, his speculation no more than a hunch.
Yet, the event had unfolded precisely as he had predicted.
John concealed his relief and turned his attention to the rest of the room. As
he surveyed his classmates, their somber expressions tugged at his empathy.
It appeared that many hadn't cracked the puzzle in time, their confusion
plainly written on their faces.
Of course, some might have been pretending to be surprised. He narrowed
his gaze and fixed it on the girl seated at the far left.
“Charlotte doesn't look too bothered,” he said to himself.
“Did she see this coming? Or was she just attentive enough during the
introductions to breeze through those questions?”
Judging by her earlier behavior, John concluded it was probably the latter.
She seemed well on her way to a perfect score.
Well, unless...
"Why don't we reveal the results of this little exercise?" Mr.
Archibald's voice cut through the silence as he produced a tablet seemingly
out of thin air.
This time, no one batted an eyelid.
Since they had just taken a Computer-Based Test, it was quite reasonable to
expect that their results would be marked by the System’s algorithm within
moments.
A few appeared anxious, clearly unprepared to face their scores, but there
was nothing they could do at this point.

BRRRNNGGG!!!
A sudden burst of pings echoed throughout the room, momentarily breaking
the heavy tension as everyone's devices chimed. Slowly, the noise faded,
and the tablets lit up with individual results.
"You may all check your results. I have them here as well," the
homeroom teacher announced, casting a glance at his tablet, mirroring the
actions of his students.
John's gaze flickered towards his tablet, and as anticipated, his results
glowed before him—a perfect score.
A perfect score, huh? Looks like I was right. But that means… His attention
shifted towards Charlotte, noting the troubled expression on her face.
She didn't get a perfect score.
A hint of disappointment seeped into John's thoughts. His knowledge had
its limits, and certain aspects required independent assessment. One of
those variables was related to the determining factor of the just-concluded
test.
"I will now reveal the overall results of this exercise," Mr. Matthias
declared.
The students lifted their heads, their eyes fixed on the youthful face of their
teacher. He seemed to relish the moment, providing a stark contrast to the
reactions of the classroom.
"Would you look at that? Of twenty-five students, only ten managed
to attain an average score or higher."
Guilt-ridden expressions washed over the faces of multiple students, their
nervousness evident in glistening beads of sweat.
"Among the ten, only five accurately recalled over twenty names."
Anxiously, the students scanned the room, trying to figure out who among
them had managed to score so well.
"Only three students managed to correctly note at least twenty-three
names..."

The exercise allowed for a maximum of twenty-four entries, requiring
students to accurately name their respective classmates. According to their
teacher, some students came close to perfection.
"And... only one of you obtained a perfect score."
John maintained his smile, he remained unfazed, as though the teacher's
remark held no significance for him.
"So, that concludes it. I must say—"
"Excuse me, sir, may I ask a question?"
In the quiet classroom, a voice broke the silence, instantly recognized by
every student. The responsible student raised their hand, seeking attention.
"Yes, Charlotte Olivia. What's the matter?" The room fell silent as all
eyes turned toward Charlotte. Her face held a blend of confusion and
suspicion.
With a hint of uncertainty, she spoke, her voice trembling slightly.
"I didn't get a perfect score, but I'm absolutely certain I wrote down
every single name. Could there have been an error in the assessment?"
Sitting beside her, the bespectacled Noah adjusted his glasses and nodded in
agreement.
Perhaps he was the other person who had fallen short of a perfect score by
just a single point. That would explain the slight frustration on his face.
Mr. Matthias, the authoritative figure in front of the class, cleared his throat
before responding.
"Regarding that issue, I can assure you that there were no errors in the
assessment. Our esteemed Academy is renowned for its excellence, and we
don't overlook such minor details."
No one dared to challenge Mr. Matthias's words, yet Charlotte remained
unsatisfied. A spark of determination ignited within her, as she persisted,
"Then, which answer did I get wrong? I'm sure I got everything right!"
The fiery intensity in her eyes and the frustration etched on her face were
clear signs of her honesty.

"Disclosing the complete breakdown of our exercises is against the
school's policy," Mr. Matthias explained, his tone firm but empathetic.
"However, I have a personal copy here, and I can confirm that you typed in
one incorrect name."
Charlotte gritted her teeth, her frustration increasing by the second. It was
clear she couldn't understand the situation. Or perhaps, deep down, she
understood all too well but was reluctant to accept it, due to her purehearted nature.
This is why she’s naïve… John’s perceptive gaze scanned Charlotte, taking
in her every reaction.
She seemed to be naively rejecting the only reasonable explanation that
arose from the present circumstances.
Someone lied about their name.
______________________________________

As the minutes ticked by and Mr. Matthias exited the classroom, there was a
shift in the atmosphere of the classroom, as the dissatisfied students found
their voices. Complaints and murmurs spilled from their lips, swiftly
spreading like wildfire through the room.
Lost in her thoughts, Charlotte remained unaware of the chaotic atmosphere
engulfing the class.
It was a crucial moment, one that would define her role in the class. Would
she summon the courage to stand tall once more, or yield to the heavy
despondency that hung in the air?
Without hesitation, her decision was made.
"Everyone, may I have your attention, please?" Charlotte's voice
resonated, slicing through the noise in the classroom. While a few
continued their conversations, a hush slowly descended over the room.
"EXCUSE ME, EVERYONE!"
This time, she walked confidently towards the front of the class, exuding a
fresh sense of determination.

The power of her presence, combined with her unwavering charisma,
emphasized the determination shining in her eyes. Gradually, the lingering
whispers came to a halt as the remaining students, who had previously been
indifferent, shifted their attention to her.
In that electrifying moment, Charlotte had seized control of the room.
"I propose that we all team up and work together, starting now. Even
though this situation caught us off guard, it's not completely hopeless. In
fact, we've learned something important: to be more attentive to what's
happening around us."
The room filled with murmurs, but Charlotte silenced them with her next
statement.
"Based on the results presented, I have realized two important things."
Nobody could resist the allure of receiving free intel, especially when it
came from someone as intelligent as Charlotte. Consequently, no one
interrupted her speech.
"First, when we were introducing ourselves, someone gave a false
name."
"Elaborate."
The bespectacled boy spoke up, causing Charlotte to pause momentarily.
She probably couldn't help but wonder if "elaborate" was the only word in
the boy's vocabulary.
"I'm pretty good at remembering faces and names. I went out of my
way to remember all your names during our introductions, so it was quite a
surprise when I noticed I got an answer wrong."
The vivacious blonde girl from the earlier introductions smirked and said,
"It’s probably because you made a mistake." Her comment incited giggles
from her group of girls.
Their laughter seemed unusually loud for a group of five.
Mia Elena, huh? Charlotte recalled how she had introduced herself last,
capturing the attention of everyone else. It was most likely a deliberate
move.

Charlotte also noted that the giggling girls were the same ones who had
kept talking when she tried to get the class' attention. Mia's mischievous
smirk and her companions' obnoxious giggles made it evident they held a
grudge against her.
"I seriously doubt that. I'm absolutely certain of what I’m saying,
and I have no motive to mislead anyone here," Charlotte declared firmly,
her words oozing with conviction.
"I've been openly sharing my observations with all of you, even
questioning the credibility of the test. Every action I have taken has been in
the best interests of everyone here, so it's disappointing to have doubts cast
on me now."
Glares were instantly aimed at Mia Elena, and she responded with a
disapproving click of her tongue, averting her eyes. The laughter quickly
faded away.
“Smart move,” John quietly commented, smiling at the entire exchange.
Charlotte's influence in the class allowed her to incite a majority of students
to silence the resistance put up by Mia.
"Now, let's move forward. As I was saying, I suspect someone
deliberately provided a false name during their introduction."
Charlotte's eyes swept across the classroom, briefly glancing at John before
looking away. She was undoubtedly searching for a guilty face, but what
good would it do? Whoever had given the deceptive introduction must have
been a good liar.
"The reasoning behind my claim might sound baseless, but I am sure
that I remembered the name correctly. I believe some of you might share a
similar sentiment, thinking you could have scored better in the exercise
based on the answers you provided."
By tapping into a common sentiment, Charlotte successfully piqued the
class' interest.
Even if it was just for the sake of scores they wouldn't have gotten anyway,
the majority of students started to embrace the idea she had presented.

"The second thing I observed is that one of us got a perfect score.
These two points intersect, leading to a single conclusion."
Ah... John quietly assessed the situation, casually watching the girl.
"The liar and the person who attained the perfect score... they're likely
one and the same. The perpetrator must have cunningly deceived everyone,
with the sole purpose of claiming all the points for themselves.”
"We have a traitor among us, and I intend to expose them," Charlotte
declared firmly.
John briefly closed his eyes, sighing softly.
Why?
… You're mistaken, Charlotte.
Once more, John couldn't help but feel disappointed by the girl's
conclusion. Although anyone with basic common sense would have similar
thoughts, for some inexplicable reason, he found himself dissatisfied with
Charlotte's response.
I got a perfect score, but I didn't falsify my name. John's gaze flickered for a
moment before settling on Charlotte. There's someone here who
intentionally provided a false name, and she's right about that. I just didn’t
fall for that person’s trick.
John had simply outsmarted the culprit, causing him to attain a perfect
score.
The real culprit wouldn't draw attention to themselves by getting a perfect
score. He mused.
This was precisely why he found Charlotte's flawed assessment
unsatisfactory. She wasn't lacking in analytical skills, but, by John's
standards, she fell short. Her reasoning had several gaps, and she struggled
to present enough evidence to back up her claims.
However, perhaps her most significant weakness lay in her tendency to
make assumptions.
You presume too much, Charlotte. While it may be impossible to fully
decipher a person's intentions or read their thoughts...

John's smile widened, as his analytical brain continued to process the scene
before him.
… One can certainly influence them.
______________________________________

There is no ‘I’ in ‘Teamwork,’ but without an individual, there can be no
collective.
The concept of selflessness as an act of responsibility is vague in a
gathering of distinct personalities.
Where competitors are gathered to form a team, the priority is the
‘individual’ before the ‘collective.’
Lost in these thoughts, John silently observed the futile scenario before him.
It seemed pointless from his perspective.
"Please speak up," Charlotte pleaded, her voice firm yet laced with a
glimmer of hope.
"Even though I don't like what you did, I just want the truth from
whoever caused all this."
Whether this plea would resonate with the architect of the present confusion
was uncertain. As expected, though, the culprit decided to stay silent,
ignoring Charlotte's heartfelt request.
"Don't bother," a stern voice interrupted, its deep and commanding
tone grabbing everyone's attention.
As his words echoed through the room, hearts raced. This boy had a
powerful presence, and his German accent only added to his imposing aura.
While Charlotte's strength lay in her direct and friendly nature, this young
man exuded authority.
"This isn't getting us anywhere," he declared, rising from his seat to
reveal his tall, well-built figure. "The person responsible won't confess.
Someone who would lie so boldly to us. Why would they suddenly have a
change of heart?"

Silence followed his statement, and perhaps deep down, everyone
recognized he was right.
"My name is Ben Elias. You might remember hearing my name during
the introductions, but you don't have to take my word for it. I have
evidence. See?" With a flourish, he pulled out his Student ID Card and
displayed it to the entire class.
A few people started to grasp his intentions, but Ben emphasized his point.
"Let's all display our Student ID Cards. This way, we can reveal the
liar among us."
It was a brilliant plan, forward-thinking and bold. Charlotte might have
hesitated multiple times before resorting to such drastic measures, but Ben
Elias showed no concern for caution.
"A breach of trust has taken place in our class," he continued, his
voice filled with urgency.
"If we don't address it right away, we risk breaking our unity, giving
Year 1A an advantage. To rebuild trust, transparency is essential."
Ben shot a quick glance in Charlotte's direction, silently seeking her
approval. Despite his logical reasoning and the substantial evidence on his
side, it was clear who held more influence in the classroom.
"I agree with Ben," Charlotte announced, displaying her Student ID
Card and thereby proving her innocence as well.
Caught in a delicate situation, where resisting would raise suspicion,
everyone reluctantly complied. Some showed indifference, while others
followed with reluctance. Yet, a shared curiosity about the traitor's identity
united the students.
However...
"Everyone's ID card is genuine. What's happening here?" Charlotte
whispered, her puzzled gaze fixed on the person who had suggested this
approach.
He appeared flustered and unable to respond. The sudden turn of events had
disrupted his composure. Ben, too, mirrored Charlotte's confusion.
He had likely thought this tactic would undoubtedly unveil the wrongdoer.

“This won't work,” John sighed barely audibly, aware of the futility of
relying solely on ID cards.
The cards were distributed a week before the commencement of classes,
along with the uniforms. Forgery isn’t exactly uncommon…
The wrongdoer had gone to great lengths, using both a fake name and a
fabricated ID. John couldn't help but be impressed, acknowledging their
meticulous preparation and their ability to provide false evidence to back up
their fake identity.
Yet, there had to be another way to uncover the truth. If only Mr. Archibald
had disclosed the test results. However, since he didn't, the students had to
find a solution on their own.
______________________________________

As the air crackled with anticipation, the classroom transformed into a hive
of restless minds, each teeming with ideas, desperate to expose the elusive
traitor lurking among them.
It was no longer a simple competition; their trust and unity hung by a
thread.
If only Mr. Archibald had disclosed our scores, we could all go through the
results. By examining the scores and identifying the one name that everyone
got wrong, we'd narrow it down considerably. John mused to himself,
quietly observing everyone's reaction to the current predicament.
Based on probability alone, it’s more likely to find the common denominator
and identify the culprit using this method.
Unfortunately, although this approach would have produced the best
outcome, John had doubts about its practicality, even in a scenario where
they had access to the complete breakdown of their scores.
It was likely that the culprit felt similarly, rendering it a solution that could
only exist in his mind.
With Charlotte discussing a name faker, and Ben inciting everyone with the
ID card proposal, it would be incredibly challenging for the students to
calm down and agree to reveal their scores.

There’s no established trust. Besides, those who failed badly are unlikely to
want to show their scores; they'd prefer to remain anonymous to save face.
As a result, it would be almost impossible to identify the common
denominator in this situation.
Charlotte might have considered this method as well. After all, she was
brilliant.
But she, too, would encounter the same problem: would everyone be
willing to reveal their scores?
There might be a way around that issue, but I'm not sure she'll even
consider it. I mean, since she's so confident in her abilities, just seeing the
complete breakdown of her results would likely enable her to pinpoint who
the name faker is.
John decided not to consider the matter any further. There was something
else that piqued his interest.
It was the culprit himself!
Why would you risk tearing the class apart, jeopardizing your chances of
success?
Richardson Elite Academy placed a significant emphasis on personal ability
alongside group effort. As outlined in the academy's prospectus, a document
in the possession of every student, the total score each individual could rack
up on their own made up only fifty percent of their overall grade.
The rest was allocated to the collective efforts of the class.
In essence, fifty percent personal effort and fifty percent class performance.
To advance to the next class, they needed at least seventy percent. This
meant the class performance had to be around the average.
John couldn't figure out why the culprit had acted this way, and it didn't
seem to make much sense.
But this is fine too…
Wasn't this the very reason he had chosen this school? To uncover the
mysteries of a world beyond the limits of his sheltered life.

The school alarm's sharp ring jolted him from his thoughts, and he
instinctively turned toward the classroom door, eager for the next teacher's
arrival.
A smile tugged at his lips, a blend of determination and curiosity.
“I can’t wait to start learning.”
______________________________________

The remaining classes, each lasting an hour, were taught by different
instructors.
In between classes, Charlotte persistently tried to communicate with the
elusive culprit, longing for a response, but her pleas went unanswered.
Frustrated, she changed her approach and openly shared her email address,
hoping the culprit would contact her privately.
Having already gained trust, Charlotte believed that only a few would doubt
her words. She clung to the hope that the impostor would realize the risk of
continuing their act, not just for the class but also for their future at
Richardson Academy.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the clock struck 12:30 PM,
announcing the arrival of the Long Break.
Having endured three consecutive classes, the students eagerly embraced
the chance to unwind and grab a bite to eat, or perhaps step outside for
some fresh air, depending on their preferences.
John felt a deep sense of envy as he stared wistfully at the desirable seats by
the windows. He longed to be one of the lucky five who could enjoy the
stunning view of the drifting clouds or the expansive fields beyond the
classroom.
“Maybe my grandfather can help me find a way to get one of those
seats,” John thought, realizing how childish his desire was.
Still, the desire for those coveted seats consumed his mind, even
overshadowing the importance of finding the culprit and helping his
classmates.
“It would've been so cool, so beautiful…”

The break lasted about half an hour. John decided to stay in the classroom,
only stepping outside for a moment to watch students heading to the
cafeteria before quickly returning.
Inside the classroom, he watched groups forming, listened in on
conversations, and carefully observed his surroundings. Gathering and
absorbing information was his modus operandi.
To avoid seeming weird for being alone, John grabbed his tablet. It had
become an essential tool for taking notes and accessing the materials
teachers provided.
While students had access to items like paper, pens, highlighters, and even
crayons, they quickly realized that the tablet was their most important
academic companion.
Still, John couldn't help but notice that no one else seemed to use the tablet
outside classes.
"Isn't it strange?" he mused aloud. If the others had tried to explore the
possibilities of their assigned devices beyond class, they might have found
an alternative solution to their problem.
"Hey there, I noticed what you're doing," a girl waved at John and
approached him, interrupting his thoughts.
To his surprise, it was Charlotte who had come over.
"Um... hi?" John replied, taken aback by her presence. His voice was
quiet but not entirely inaudible.
Charlotte offered a friendly smile, her warmth apparent despite her hushed
tone.
"I'm just curious about how you're using the tablet even after class.
Don't they shut down after the teacher's done?" She asked, genuinely
interested.
John's heart raced, wondering where she had appeared from. He started to
compose himself, trying not to smile too broadly and seem foolish.
He couldn't just sit there stiffly, that would be rude.
But how could he not? After all, she was the first girl his age to ever speak
to him!

"Well, there's no rule against it," John finally replied, lifting his tablet
to demonstrate to Charlotte.
Thankfully, he regained his composure before she could notice his earlier
nervousness.
"You just swipe your Student ID right here, and the tablet activates.
Then you can use it for various things."
Charlotte's eyes widened as John explained, his innocent smile matching
her surprise.
Deep inside, a longing stirred within him.
Please notice it, he silently pleaded. Please pick up on the subtle hint I'm
giving you!
His heart raced, uncertain if his unspoken desire would reach her.
He could only wait and hope.
"Wait... doesn't that mean only real IDs can unlock the tablets? If we
assume the student who lied about their name is using a fake ID card, we
can use this to identify them!" Charlotte exclaimed with amazement, then
quickly lowered her voice.
You've figured it out. Great! John felt a rush of relief and joy.
He had underestimated Charlotte. She not only had a quick mind but a
sharp eye for detail. Even without his help, she would have figured it out
eventually.
"I'll bring this up during our next short break," Charlotte said with a
smile.
As she spoke, John glanced around the half-empty classroom. He sensed a
few curious looks in their direction, although he doubted anyone could hear
their conversation. Thankfully, Charlotte knew when to speak quietly and
be tactful.
Despite his earlier admiration for her, John felt a hint of unease regarding
her proposed solution.
"Um... I'm not sure it's a great idea," he hesitated.
"Oh? Why's that?" She tilted her head, curious.

"I mean, don't you think you've already done a lot today? Doing
more might make you seem too pushy. It's important to exercise moderation
in everything," John said, even though he lacked practical knowledge on the
subject.
I'm just repeating what Grandfather told me...
His words still rang true, and he was certain Charlotte had also come to
realize it by now. Pushing others to cooperate further would only paint her
as overly bossy.
After all, she wasn't even the Class Representative.
"I... I understand. You're right," she acknowledged.
Quick on the uptake. Impressive! If John's body hadn't been immobilized
under her gaze, he would have given Charlotte a thumbs-up. There was also
the fact that other students had their eyes on them too.
While he wasn't entirely in the clear, the conversation flowed so effortlessly
that even John was surprised by his ability to keep pace. It was his first time
engaging in such a dialogue, yet he was doing remarkably well.
All those hours he had spent practicing in front of the mirror had paid off
more than he had anticipated.
Nevertheless, there was something else he noticed as he talked to the girl in
front of him.
This... it's different! His thoughts echoed, and he felt an unexplainable rush
in his chest. He couldn't quite put it into words, but his heart was racing.
"Thank you."
A warm feeling washed over John's heart, and his cheeks turned a rosy hue
the moment he heard Charlotte's words. His heart even skipped a beat.
This, this is...! It certainly wasn't an unpleasant feeling.
John had received "thank yous" from various people before, but the impact
of this particular one felt strange and unfamiliar.
"You're welcome. Thank you too," he replied.
Charlotte seemed briefly surprised, but then a smile lit up her face.

"Well, I'll catch up with you later, John. The break's almost over. It was
nice talking to you."
"Likewise."
As Charlotte Olivia gracefully returned to her seat, John couldn't help but
watch her every step, every subtle move. Something deep inside him had
begun to stir.
The pressure subsided as Charlotte left, and John felt a newfound sense of
clarity.
"I guess I'll talk to her later, after all," he mumbled to himself.
As the break ended, everyone returned to their seats, getting ready for the
next class. But John's mind was elsewhere. For the first time, he was
oblivious to the people and activities around him.
Lost in thought, he closed his eyes and let his mind wander freely. A mix of
emotions welled up in him, driven by the desire to have more conversations
with Charlotte.
Whenever he thought of her, something inside him surged. Suddenly, her
smiling face was all he could think about.
He couldn't help but wonder what might have happened if he had chosen
different words or actions. It was irrational, given that the past was in the
past, but the thought persisted.
“What am I doing?” John sighed quietly to himself, closing his eyes
and maintaining a smile on his face to hide his inner turmoil.
He slowly opened his eyes and came to a surprising realization.
I really want to talk to her some more…

Fear and curiosity are innate to human nature. We seek out the unknown, despite our fear of it. This
natural desire to explore the hidden drives us towards the very things that terrify us.

“ ’m home,” John spoke as he casually stepped foot inside the
large compound of his residence.
The orange glow of the evening sun dyed the grass and beautiful flowers in
different shades of green. As the young boy looked around him, observing
the polished stony path he walked on, and the beauty of nature around, he
could not suppress his smile.
The gentle breeze greeted him and the sweet scent of flowers in bloom
tingled his nose. John took in all the wonderful sights and smells as he
walked straight to the building that stood erect at the center of the garden.
Anyone who looked at the beautiful place would be amazed by the
harmonious blend of civilization and nature, but because John was just
returning from a much more impressive place, he wasn’t fazed by its quiet
beauty.
Perhaps it was the familiarity of the place that dulled his sense of wonder.
After all, he had been living here with his grandfather for a little over a
month.
Taking in his surroundings, John found nothing but the simple, expansive
beauty of the well-maintained field and the quaint two-story house. With a
deep breath, he stepped inside.
"Back already, John?" His grandfather's warm voice greeted the young
boy as he entered the living room.

Dr. Lucien sat at the dining table, right beside the door John had just come
through. He was enjoying a healthy meal of a fresh fruit and vegetable
salad, accompanied by a jar of soy milk. His mouth was full of the crisp
taste of grapes, cucumbers, and fresh basil leaves.
"Yeah, I'm back. School ends at 3:00 PM, you know," John said,
glancing at the time on the house clock; it had been more than twenty
minutes since school let out.
The elderly man chuckled.
"Right, right, I guess I forgot."
"Well, I'm heading to my room for a shower. I haven't felt this
exhausted in a long time, if ever." John left the living room, passed by his
grandfather, and headed towards the stairs that led to his room.
John couldn't wait to get to his room, but his grandfather's voice interrupted
him.
"So, how was your first day of school?"
When the question came, he'd barely set foot on the stair's elevated
platform.
How fast can he finish a spoonful of food? John wondered. Although his
cheerful expression didn't betray his impatience. He quickly refocused and
decided to answer his grandfather's question.
"Ah, well..." He started, but the image of the girl flashed in his mind
as soon as he did. Long, brown hair, an innocent smile, and violet irises
radiating confidence and charisma. John couldn't forget the smallest details
about her face.
He couldn't forget her, even if he tried.
A smile involuntarily crept onto his face, and his heart raced before he
regained control. There was something about Charlotte Olivia that left a
lasting mark on his mind, more so than anything else.
"I... I'm not really sure," John admitted in a hushed tone, a touch of
hesitation in his voice.
He simply didn't have enough information to make a proper assessment.
After all, a good review required strong, objective knowledge, but the

thoughts swirling in his head felt too muddled and insufficient.
“I didn’t mean you should analyze it. I just want to hear your honest
thoughts about the place. How's it going with your classmates? Are you
comfortable there? Anything that's piqued your interest?" Dr. Matthew
asked, sighing softly.
His face, wrinkled with concern yet tinged with curiosity, softened as he
locked eyes with the young boy's troubled, vacant smile. He couldn't help
but feel his heart warm.
"Just tell me how you felt when you were there," he said, unable to
keep his thoughts to himself any longer. John's hesitation pushed him to
speak, and now he could only watch in silence as his grandson pondered the
question.
For a moment, John's mind became a whirlwind of memories from his
eventful day.
A rapid stream of images, faces, places, voices, and emotions flooded his
thoughts. He relived the moment he entered the school and revisited the
events of the day until he finally left the premises.
Every sensation resurfaced, vivid and intense.
"It felt... different, Grandpa, but everything's still a bit mixed up in
my head, so I can't say for sure," John explained, acknowledging his
tendency to overanalyze and observe everything.
"Is that right?" Doctor Matt sighed, hearing his grandson's words.
This had always been John's problem. He was too analytical, too observant.
His father had mentioned the same thing. Despite the hope for a fresh start
in a new environment, John still clung to his old habits.
‘It worries me.’ The thought weighed on the old man's mind, but he felt
powerless to help his grandson.
"Well, for now, that'll do," Dr. Matthew sighed, offering a weary
smile that revealed his disappointment in John's response.
‘Did he really spend the entire day in silence, just observing others?’ The
thought lingered in his mind.

"We had a general assembly where all the students met. I got to see
everyone's faces. Your friend, Dr. Charles Richardson, gave a great opening
speech. Oh, and the homeroom teacher was really good. We introduced
ourselves in class, so I learned everyone's names. We also did a fun class
activity and took part in enjoyable lectures together. Learning with
everyone was a blast!"
John's voice was filled with excitement, yet there was a subtle hint of
sadness that tugged at Dr. Matthew's heart. He concealed his concern with a
forced smile. This was for the best.
"Did you make any new friends?" Dr. Matt asked.
"Not yet, but it's okay," John replied.
"Is that so? Well, there's no need to hurry, as long as you're trying
new things. I'm glad the school is a good fit for you. It looks like we made
the right choice."
"You're right. Leaving that stifling place and coming to the city was
worth it. It's a lot more fun here," John grinned, nodding in agreement with
his grandfather.
A moment of quiet settled between them, and they exchanged thoughtful
glances. Dr. Matthew offered a warm smile to his intelligent young
grandson, and John responded with his usual cheerful grin.
But just as the silence seemed endless, a sudden realization shattered the
tranquility.
"Oh, right! I forgot to have lunch," John casually mentioned.
Dr. Matthew couldn't believe his ears.
"WHAT?! John, come on! We talked about this! You need to take care
of yourself!" He quickly set aside his salad and got up from his chair,
tempted to rush to John's side to ensure he was okay, but he held back.
"Well, I could have gone to the cafeteria, but I was too busy
observing everyone," John admitted with an awkward laugh.
"Even so..." Dr. Matthew couldn't understand how his grandson
could neglect his basic needs in favor of observing others. He knew the
underlying reason behind John's behavior, but he still couldn't allow it.

"You have to eat something. Go freshen up quickly, and I'll make
something good for you."
"Oh? Great! Will there be chocolate? Please say there'll be
chocolate!" John asked with excitement.
"Take it easy..." The old man held his chest, taking slow, deep breaths.
He couldn't help but envy the boundless energy in the boy. But he also
wondered about John's unusual love for chocolate.
"Pleaseeee!" His face had never appeared so radiant and full of life.
His blue eyes shimmered with childlike wonder, all thanks to a single, yet
profound, reason.
CHOCOLATE!
"Hahaha! Well..." Dr. Matt's eyes sparkled mischievously as he
watched his grandson, his sly smile giving away a playful plan. Perhaps
denying John his favorite treat would teach him not to skip meals.
"Grandpa, please. Pretty please!"
Unfortunately, Dr. Matthew miscalculated. He couldn't resist those adorable
eyes for long. In a matter of seconds, his fate was sealed. John won.
But who could blame him? The boy's charm was simply irresistible.
"Fine, fine. You win. Just go shower, change, and come back down."
They both laughed happily, as Dr. Matt scratched his head awkwardly, his
expression a mix of surrender and amusement.
Dr. Matthew knew he should say "no" more often, but as a somewhat outof-touch parent, he struggled with the complexities of raising a child.
However, in this case, he felt that John deserved a treat.
"Oh, there's something I wanted to ask," John's laughter faded as he
began to climb the stairs.
"What is it?" Dr. Matt, already wearing his apron, turned his attention
to the pleasant sound of his grandson's voice.
No one could quite explain how a man his age could move so gracefully.
Perhaps it was due to his daily exercise routine.

John knew that inquiring about it would inevitably lead to a discussion
about bodybuilding—a topic he desperately wanted to avoid. The mere
thought of lifting weights and becoming as muscular as his grandfather sent
chills down his spine.
"Can we talk to the school about changing my seat? I wasn't assigned a
window seat," John said.
Dr. Matthew's discomfort grew, and the situation became increasingly
awkward. He watched the sparkle in John's eyes fade in an instant.
His grandson had entered one of his gloomy moods.
"I really want that seat."
"W-well, there's no straightforward way to ask the school. Even though
Dr. Charles Richardson and I go way back to our Ph.D. days, I doubt he can
pull any strings for this," Dr. Matthew sighed, feeling a sense of
disappointment.
Shouldn't John have known all of this already? Why did he bother asking?
Dr. Matthew thought to himself.
"I figured. Alright then..." After a brief moment of disappointment,
John finally replied and continued up the stairs.
"W-wait!"
John paused, his feet just inches from the top. He slowly tilted his head, his
black hair swaying, and his face turning toward his grandfather's concerned
expression.
"Why don't you try making friends there? If you become friends
with someone who has a window seat, you could trade with them. You'll
gain a new friend and also get the seat. Isn't that a good idea?"
Dr. Matthew couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt for suggesting this
solution. It felt somewhat transactional as if he were encouraging John to
befriend people for personal gain. Friendship should be about emotional
connections, not exchanging favors. While that was often how real-world
relationships worked, he couldn't shake off the discomfort of steering his
grandson down that path.

"You're right. That sounds reasonable. It should work." Unsurprisingly,
John nodded, instantly understanding the logic behind the suggestion.
A relieved smile spread across Dr. Matthew's face. "Y-yeah, exactly!"
The idea might have been flawed, but sometimes the end justifies the
means, doesn't it? John would have likely remained hesitant for a while,
content with observing people from the sidelines. But at least this way, he
could actively work on building a friendship.
"Thanks, Grandpa. Oh, before I forget, I need to pick up something
from the store later today." John continued up the stairs, his voice fading.
"Yeah? Well, you need to eat first!"
"Got it." John kept climbing, never looking back or pausing. Yet,
there was something peculiar about his comment, something that caught Dr.
Matthew's attention. He had mentioned it earlier, but Dr. Matt had only
noticed it now.
"I see what you did there, John. Hahaha!" Dr. Matthew, the astute
one, quickly caught the hidden joke. "I didn't know you had a knack for
humor."
"Hehehe." John returned his grandfather's smile, a mischievous glint
in his eyes. This was one of the few things he could be witty about.
"Well, I just started today."
A moment of quiet passed between them. John gazed deeply into his
grandfather's captivating, deep blue eyes. An unspoken connection flowed
between them, and their smiles synchronized. Before long...
"Hahahahahaha!"
Laughter erupted once more, filling the air with joyful noise. John
continued up the stairs, leaving the echoes of their laughter behind. His
sparkling eyes danced with excitement and anticipation as he contemplated
something his grandfather had mentioned.
‘Friends, huh?’
______________________________________

The next day came, and John took his place in the classroom at precisely
8:40 AM, a full ten minutes before Homeroom started and another ten
minutes before the official start of classes.
Sitting there, he couldn't help but mutter, "I made a mistake," realizing he
had arrived early with nothing to do in those valuable minutes. Without any
friends yet, and stuck in a seat he didn't particularly like, he promised
himself not to lose his smile.
Glancing at the empty seat by the classroom window, assigned to Charlotte,
he sighed in disappointment. He had come early in hopes of spending time
with her or maybe striking up a conversation, but it seemed fate had
different plans for him today.
She hadn't shown up yet.
"This is so boring..." John muttered to himself, feeling the monotony
weighing on him. If not for the few students already in the room, he might
have considered moving closer to the window to satisfy his curiosity.
"But that might seem weird, right?" he wondered.
Just as John whispered these thoughts, a voice echoed in the classroom
entrance, causing him to quickly turn his head.
"Hey, Charlotte. You're here already," the voice called.
The girl who had just entered the classroom had a crown of brown hair, and
her violet eyes sparkled like sapphires.
"She's here!" He thought to himself excitedly as he gazed at Charlotte.
Once again, John's heart raced as he watched her graceful steps. Trying to
appear nonchalant, he pretended not to notice her, unsure of what to do if
their eyes were to meet.
"Hi. You're here early too," Charlotte's response to the girl who
greeted her reached his ears, nearly causing his heart to skip a beat.
Heat rushed to his cheeks, making him hide his face by burying it in his
desk. Nonetheless, he couldn't help but steal glances in her direction,
catching snippets of her conversation with the brown-haired girl.
"Yeah, I thought we could have a punctuality test."

"Really? Hahaha."
"By the way, did you braid your hair?"
"Yes, I'm trying a new style."
"The dorms were comfy, and I had lots of free time."
"I was so nervous I couldn't sleep."
"Me too!"
From his cautious vantage point, John observed Charlotte as she effortlessly
moved from one group of classmates to another, engaging them in
conversation with grace. Her radiant smile and poised demeanor exuded
confidence, and he couldn't tear his eyes away from her magnetic presence.
"She's really popular," John murmured, feeling a bit down.
Charlotte had a natural talent for connecting with people. While John
believed he could improve with some effort, he wondered if anyone could
truly match her level of conversational finesse.
His grandfather always encouraged him to have faith in himself and others.
Maybe that was the key.
“Just how much experience does she—?” John abruptly stopped midsentence, noticing Charlotte's gaze shifting in his direction. Panic surged
through him as he realized he had stopped hiding his face and had been
openly staring at her all this time.
‘Oh, how embarrassing!’ His thoughts must have been written all over his
face.
Luckily, it seemed Charlotte hadn't noticed his awkwardness. Instead, her
smile widened when their eyes met, and she even waved at him.
‘Is she looking at me? Is she waving... to me?’ John had never
experienced such gestures in class before, especially not from someone as
popular as Charlotte.
What was he supposed to do in response? He was supposed to wave back,
right?
Right?!

Unfortunately, John was paralyzed by self-doubt, unable to react. He could
only silently watch as she eventually lowered her hand.
Charlotte appeared slightly exasperated and made her way over to John.
Before he knew it, she was standing right in front of him.
"I was greeting you from afar, and you ignored me. That's not fair,
John," she teased, her lips forming a mock frown. Despite her playful act of
being upset, it was obvious she was joking.
"A-ah, you were? I... I'm sorry, I—" John stammered, struggling to
find the right words in response.
"I was just kidding, John. No need to take it so seriously," Charlotte
replied to his flustered expression with a light giggle.
"Haha, seriously? I was caught off guard... Charlotte."
"You remembered my name?" Charlotte asked, her voice genuinely
surprised.
"Of course! You're the class celebrity. I'm even more amazed that you
remembered mine," John replied, smiling softly.
"I've mentioned this before, but I never forget a face or a name. We're
going to be studying together for a while, so I want to get along with
everyone."
"Wow, you're practically a pro at it," John remarked, glancing around
the classroom. Charlotte had managed to make friends with almost
everyone in no time. If that wasn't impressive, what was?
"Well, I've only managed to connect with some of our classmates. It's
kinda tough to get to know the others... especially—well, never mind,"
Charlotte hesitated, her words trailing off as she likely considered whether
it was appropriate to say anything negative about her classmates.
Even if she didn't say anything, John had a sense of which people might be
causing trouble for her.
Mia Elena and her group, huh? She sure has it rough. It doesn't look like
she's going to give up anytime soon...
John's voice slipped out in a whisper, barely audible, "So naive..."

"What was that?"
"Ah, nothing," John quickly covered, offering a nervous smile. The
weight of Charlotte's awesomeness still felt heavy on him, and a bead of
sweat formed on his forehead.
“...”
In that brief moment, an awkward tension hung in the air as both of them
engaged in a silent exchange.
To John's relief, Charlotte eventually broke the silence.
"Well, I'll see you later, John," she said, waving as she turned to go.
Surprisingly, John found himself waving back.
‘It's a step-by-step process, huh? Grandpa was right.’
Although their conversation didn't hold any profound meaning or a clear
purpose, unlike his usual interactions, John didn't entirely dislike it.
I might be capable of engaging in small talk, but that doesn't mean I enjoy
it. Still…
There was something about Charlotte that fascinated him, making him
engage in a typically ordinary conversation.
Something that went beyond his understanding.
“I want to talk to her again. I guess we'll have another conversation
later,” John decided, a glimmer of anticipation lighting up inside him as he
picked up the tablet under his desk, looking forward to their next meeting.
______________________________________

Mr. Archibald conducted Homeroom with remarkable precision, starting
right on time and ending before 9:00 AM.
This time, he sported an elegant navy blue blazer over a crisp white shirt,
paired with matching blue trousers and polished black shoes. Compared to
the previous day, Mr. Archibald looked even more sharp, giving off a
relaxed yet refined vibe.

As he beamed with a captivating smile and radiated confidence, John
couldn't help but think, He's even more impressive than Charlotte...
With Homeroom done, it was time for the start of classes.
Their first teacher was a remarkable woman, capturing everyone's attention
with her appearance. Similar to Mr. Archibald, she embraced a casual style,
albeit with a touch of flair.
"Good morning, everyone. I assume this is your first class in the
Government Course, right? This term, I'll be your guide through the realm
of World Affairs, covering local and international issues. Brace yourselves,
as this will be an extraordinary journey," she declared, exuding authority as
she addressed the room.
John listened with rapt attention, prepared to learn from this impressive
teacher. Since his arrival at the Academy, he had been fascinated by their
innovative teaching methods.
Unlike traditional high schools that mainly focused on subjects like
Algebra, Calculus, and Biology, Richardson Elite Academy featured a truly
unique curriculum along with a distinctive approach to teaching.
The Elite Academy encompassed seven departments or areas of study:
Government
Family and Values
Business
Arts and Entertainment
Media and Technology
Religion and Philosophy
Education
Each department symbolized a pillar of society, and the Academy believed
that true genius could only be achieved by students who possessed a wellrounded understanding of every field. Therefore, subjects from all seven
areas were woven into the curriculum, with only the "Education" field
covering conventional courses like Mathematics and English.

John marveled at the stark contrast between this educational approach and
the traditional methods used in regular high schools. Seated in the
classroom, he listened intently as his teacher unveiled a whole new world of
knowledge before his eager eyes.
"So this is the essence of the Richardson Elite Academy's
curriculum," he whispered in awe.
He realized that this unique teaching methodology likely extended
throughout all levels of education within the Richardson Academy. As he
contemplated the practicality and limitless possibilities of such an approach,
John's imagination ignited, envisioning the boundless horizons that lay
ahead.
______________________________________

"This concludes our lesson for today, everyone. Have a wonderful
day," the teacher bid farewell before leaving the classroom.
As the door closed behind her, a wave of excitement spread through the
students. It was finally time for their long-awaited lunch break. They were
eager for a break after their demanding classes.
The classes at this institution were unlike any other—student-friendly yet
intensely fast-paced. This meant that students who weren't attentive could
easily fall behind.
The teachers knew how to streamline essential information, omitting
unnecessary details. They encouraged students to embark on personal
research journeys, equipping them with the necessary resources and tools.
This was no ordinary school; it catered to the exceptional.
John, rising from his seat alongside his classmates, mused to himself,
"I should grab something to eat so grandfather won’t scold me again."
John's gaze shifted to the left, where Charlotte was engrossed in her tablet, a
notably wide smile crossing his face.
With a sense of anticipation, he joined his classmates as they left the
classroom.

She's navigating the Tablet, figuring everything out before taking action.
That's good. Impulsive actions rarely lead to anything worthwhile...
John felt a surge of admiration for her as he headed toward the cafeteria, his
mouth watering at the thought of indulging in his favorite treat—
Chocolate!
______________________________________

With just five minutes left before the end of the break, John returned to his
seat. Today, he had taken a longer stroll, exploring parts of the extensive
high school campus that still left him amazed.
Although he hadn't explored the entire place yet, he had managed to visit
the captivating garden just outside the grand Main Building.
‘What a satisfying experience.’ As John reminisced about the beautiful
flowers, he noticed Charlotte conversing with a group of people in the
classroom.
‘Mikael Rufus, Christopher Hitchens... Sofia Venla too. Hmm…’
It was disappointing that he couldn't approach her as he had hoped. He
wished he could talk to her with more confidence and become friends.
Sadly, he wasn't quite there yet.
Realizing that they probably wouldn't have a chance to talk for the rest of
the day, he decided to shift his focus quickly and turned his attention to
another student in the class.
As he observed the boy conversing with his classmates, scrutinizing every
gesture and word, John had a simple thought.
I wonder how they would react if they found out they were talking to the
fake-name culprit—no, it's not just that...
Was it strange that he felt like laughing right now?
Wasn’t it hilarious how people interacted with one another, despite not
knowing the true natures that lurked within the other parties? For instance,
one could have a normal conversation with a murderer, a rapist, a

pedophile, a kidnapper, etc., yet they would enjoy their talk with such vile
people.
In a way, ignorance is truly bliss.
Lost in thought, John silently observed the socially active boy for a few
more minutes until a single chime echoed from the strategically placed
speakers in the classroom.
He let out a brief sigh, mentally preparing himself for the next lecture.
______________________________________

In contrast to the pretty stacked first day, the second day was mostly
uneventful.
The morning began with Homeroom, followed by a series of lectures that
seemed to stretch on endlessly. Time blurred as the day's canvas filled with
monotonous activities. Finally, at 3:00 PM, as the school day ended,
students bid farewell to the familiar classroom, eager to explore the
adventures awaiting them beyond its walls.
Outside, the atmosphere hummed with energy.
Some students formed lively clusters, their laughter and animated
conversations filling the air. Others sought solitude, making their way to
individual destinations, lost in their thoughts. While most students opted to
stay in the cozy Academy Dorms, some resided off-campus.
Among the discerning students who recognized the appeal of staying on
campus was Charlotte Olivia. As the final bell rang and she exchanged
heartfelt farewells with her newfound companions, particularly her dear
friend Sofia, Charlotte made her way toward the female dormitory.
Strolling along the pathways that wound through the lush campus gardens,
Charlotte couldn't help but feel as though she had entered a dream. The air
caressed her skin, crisp and invigorating as if whispering secrets of the
world.
For Charlotte, walking alone and basking in the gentle embrace of nature
was a cherished ritual.

The path was quiet, allowing her thoughts to wander, but not eerily still
enough to unsettle her. Everywhere Charlotte looked, she saw fellow
students walking around.
And, oh, it was wonderful. Being surrounded by a community of eager
minds, all working together toward a common goal.
Of course, even in well-structured societies, there were always some who
would prove difficult. Charlotte had already noticed a few potential
troublemakers, with the most notorious one being the mysterious name
faker.
But Charlotte remained optimistic.
I'll find a way to connect with everyone! Together, we'll conquer any
challenge that comes our way! Her words may have dripped with youthful
naivety, but this wasn't her first rodeo when it came to group dynamics.
In fact, collaboration was her strong suit. That was why, despite the current
situation in Grade 9B, she stayed determined.
It's far too early to jump to conclusions. I'll give it my all and work through
the issues on my end. Time has a way of bringing people together. Charlotte
firmly believed she could help her peers succeed if they allowed her to lead.
“I'll make sure our group wins, no matter what!” Charlotte repeated her
usual mantra, clenching her fist with unwavering determination.
As she approached her dormitory, a feeling of sadness washed over her,
mixed with the bittersweet understanding that her lovely walk was coming
to an end.
‘Well, I've got a ton of stuff to do. I guess it's for the best,’ Charlotte
thought, urging herself to walk faster.
______________________________________

"Hmm..." Charlotte let out a content sigh as the water cascaded over
her.
The refreshing shower was exactly what she needed after a long school day.
It was the reason she found comfort in her private dorm room at this hour.

Standing in the soothing embrace of the bathroom, Charlotte lost herself in
the afternoon shower, humming a soft tune and wearing a satisfied grin. She
relished the sensation of water against her skin, feeling its cool touch wake
her up.
Her dark brown hair clung to her fair skin, and she kept her eyes closed,
savoring every delightful moment.
The feeling was so amazing that it tempted her to stay there for hours.
However—
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
The sudden blaring of an alarm broke the silence, jolting Charlotte back to
reality.
"Oh, has it been thirty minutes already?" She mumbled, pressing a
button on the wall to decrease the water to a trickle. In no time, only a few
droplets dripped from the shower.
She left the bathroom, her body still wet and glistening, making sure to grab
her towels – one for her damp hair and the other for her body. She walked
gracefully to the large mirror in the minimally decorated room.
"Ah... I feel so much better," she happily sighed, her voice full of
contentment.
Charlotte looked around, impressed by her bedroom's grandeur. It wasn't
bigger than her room back home, but she marveled at the luxurious
accommodations provided at Richardson's Elite Academy.
‘This place is amazing,’ she thought to herself. Her room was painted to her
exact liking, a lovely mix of blues and violets, and it had everything a
student could need.
She had heard some students complain about rooms lacking certain
amenities, but those appeared to be minor luxuries, not essential needs.
For me, there are no complaints. This room is perfect, just the way I like it.
______________________________________

“Alright, let's begin!”

Dressed casually in an oversized white shirt and blue shorts, Charlotte sat at
her desk, ready to dive into the digital world.
She opened her trusty laptop and effortlessly typed on the keyboard. She
was excellent at multitasking. Her technique involved opening multiple
browser tabs, each dedicated to a different study topic.
Procrastination wasn't her thing, not at all. Some might say her method was
shallow or inefficient, but it worked wonders for her. She believed in
exploring different websites to soak up a lot of knowledge all at once.
It was like creating her personal buffet of information
Delicious!
“Oh, hold on! I should check my mail first,” she told herself. Charlotte
understood the importance of staying in touch, even with all her
schoolwork.
She was an extrovert, after all. With a quick click, her email opened up,
filled with messages. She had already removed the annoying junk emails.
These were all real messages from people and groups that were important.
A wide smile appeared on her face as she started going through the sea of
messages, one by one.
Dear Charlotte,
Thank you for your assistance with the International Movement For
Modern Improvements In Rural Communities.
You really pulled through for us in terms of logistics and sourcing for
support. I don’t think we could have had another successful year without
you.
It's a shame we couldn’t have you join us this year. I understand, though.
School stuff.
I certainly hope High School is treating you well. While I don’t understand
why you refuse to let us use your picture publicly, or tell us the name of
your school—so we can visit—I still appreciate all the help you’ve given.
You truly are the heart and soul of the team.

Till we meet again.
Yours sincerely,
Aidan.
"Aidan, you're such a softie. I bet you would've totally rocked it even
without my help," Charlotte giggled, her mind replaying his adorable
British accent.
She couldn't help but think about the rest of the team too. It warmed her
heart knowing how much they appreciated her, and that their collective
effort had paid off in a big way.
The feeling of making her mark and being recognized for it brought her the
greatest satisfaction.
Charlotte delved into more emails from various people and groups, each
containing a similar sentiment of gratitude or a call to action in different
fields.
She often involved herself in an array of activities—both local and global,
big and small.
There was never a dull moment.
“Looks like I need to gather a ton of resources for the upcoming
Feminist Campaign in West Africa. Oh, and there’s also the Anti-Female
Genital Mutilation Campaign in Northern Nigeria," she murmured, her
excitement building.
And let's not overlook the Movement For Climate Change Awareness. So
much to do! Charlotte took charge of her laptop, opening multiple tabs to
tackle the mountain of work awaiting her.
Despite being a young student, her schedule was packed with countless
events. She was a member of numerous teams, leaving little time for
anything else.
But her infectious smile remained, shining brighter than ever.
I love this! I love this so much!

Charlotte's work was more than just a series of activities; it was her
purpose, her passion. Each event and movement held a special place in her
heart.
It had become her life!
DING!
Just as she was about to close her email tab, a new message appeared.
"Hmm? What's this?" she murmured, her lips moving unconsciously as
her fingers clicked on the mysterious email. It came from an address she
didn’t recognize.
Anonymous Messenger. Who’s that? Charlotte had blocked all spam alerts in
her email, treating it as a sacred workspace where only trusted contacts
could reach her.
Could it be the culprit from class? Did he finally decide to confess? After
all, she had recently shared her email address with her classmates.
Of course, there were consequences to her actions. Just the day before,
several people had messaged her, trying to get closer to her.
It worked in her favor, though. The more people she connected with, the
better for her.
Unfortunately, none of the messages she received were from the culprit.
Well, none of them had a shady name like this anonymous sender. Maybe
this time...
When she opened the email, all she saw was a short sentence and an
attached video.
"Check this out. When you're done, we can talk," Charlotte repeated the
words she read on her screen.
She hesitated, her cursor hovering over the video.
Doubt filled her mind. "What am I doing? This seems suspicious. But..."
She sighed, tapping her desk nervously. Slowly, her curiosity started to
grow. The file was a short one-minute clip, less than five megabytes in size.
It was something she could easily ignore, but she could also spare a few
moments to watch it.

Thinking it over, Charlotte considered her options, but the inevitable choice
was clear.
"Fine. Let's check it out."
CLICK!
As the video played on her screen, Charlotte's eyes widened in sheer
disbelief.
“Oh no!”
Her reaction was nothing short of pure terror, a chilling scream escaping her
lips in response to the mind-boggling scene unfolding before her.
The footage depicted a school, seemingly unremarkable with just one
person in the entire one-minute clip. Yet, the scene unfolding in the clip
made Charlotte's skin break out in a cold sweat.
“T-this is—!”
She was about to recoil from the video when another message from the
same sender appeared on her screen.
Her body trembled uncontrollably, and it took her a few moments to find
the strength to check the new message. She was breathing rapidly,
overwhelmed by panic.
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No.
Charlotte found herself hyperventilating, beads of sweat glistening on her
skin, as she read the message on her screen.

I know who you are, “Faker.”

Looks like you found a new place to hide. You can fool everyone there, but
you can’t fool me. It’s a nice seat you chose for yourself. I’m glad I can see
you very clearly from that angle.
"How? Who is this...?" Charlotte's head throbbed as she grappled with
the implications of what she was seeing.
I've been so careful. Mom and Dad said everything was taken care of, and I
double-checked. Who is this person? How did they get this video? And how
did they find me here? Tremors shook Charlotte, from her quivering lips to
her trembling body.
Despite her fear, there was one more message. Summoning all her courage,
she opened it.
"Another video?"
This one was a whole hour long, adding to her growing sense of dread.
Charlotte felt completely powerless and bewildered. It was clear that the
person on the other side of the screen had control. She tapped on the video
and patiently waited for it to download.
In the silence, Charlotte's heart raced, and she continued to sweat profusely.
Questions filled her mind: Who is behind this? How did they do it? When
did they start watching me? Why are they doing this?
But she had no answers to any of them.
Finally, the video finished downloading, and Charlotte braced herself for
another shock.
"No... this can't be...!" Her worst fears became real as she watched the
video. It was her. The whole one-hour video featured Charlotte Olivia in her
classroom. Every moment was there, from taking notes on her tablet to
conversations with her classmates.
The video was clear and expertly shot from an ideal angle, capturing each
moment perfectly. It seemed edited, piecing together different clips
seamlessly.
However, one thing was clear.
They all focus on my seat!

At this point, Charlotte Olivia was teetering on the edge of confusion, her
sanity hanging by a thread. She lacked the strength to scream. Her fingers
struggled to move, but she managed to type out a reply, the only response
she could come up with in that overwhelming moment.
Who are you? What do you want?
Charlotte sent the message and quickly received a notification indicating a
reply had arrived. With a sense of trepidation, she opened it. Her heart was
racing in her chest as she desperately sought an answer to the maddening
confusion.
Ah, just call me Anonymous.
What I want is quite simple, so don’t worry.
Charlotte knew this was straight-up blackmail, so she prepared for
something awful in exchange for this horrifying secret.
What could it possibly be? Money? A specific action? Nudes? The
possibilities were endless!
People like this had no limits when it came to exerting control. Despite the
overwhelming fear, Charlotte couldn't help but wonder…
"W-what is this?"
The request sent shivers down her spine, leaving her both bewildered and
disgusted. It made no sense, yet she couldn't entirely dismiss it as irrational.
Just as Anonymous had mentioned earlier, it seemed deceptively simple.
However, given the context, it felt utterly impossible—no, it was
unthinkable.
With tears in her eyes, Charlotte continued to read the rest of the message,
tears streaming down her face and sobs escaping her lips. She was utterly
powerless as she absorbed the stalker's request, which was presented to her
in bold, imposing letters.
"Let's be friends, Charlotte."

CHAPTER 4
UNRAVELING
Assumption underlies all interactions, as the mind judges what's accurate, appropriate, or not. This
intricate web of intuitive presuppositions is integral to the operation of any society.
______________________________________

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!
"

Ugh..." A voice came from the bed as a girl shifted

uncomfortably in response to the relentless blaring of the alarm clock.
Finally, after a few groans and muttered curses, the frustrated student
reluctantly climbed out of bed and silenced the annoying noise.
Her purple pajamas complimented the light pink sheets, and her room was
surprisingly clean, in stark contrast to her disheveled hair. She slipped on
her pink flip-flops, continuing to curse as she made her way to the
bathroom.
Like a zombie, she dragged herself along, her tired eyes reflecting her
exhaustion. Unfortunately, it was early in the morning, and school
beckoned.
"I look terrible."
As Charlotte Olivia splashed water on her face, these were her first coherent
words of the day, filled with negativity. They perfectly reflected her current
mood.
Her night's sleep had been far from restful. Thoughts of the strange
messages she had received from the anonymous sender tormented her. She
couldn't forget how she trembled while watching those videos or how her
whole body shook when the stalker asked to be friends.

S-sicko! That was her immediate thought whenever the message crossed her
mind. Her fears only intensified.
Charlotte held back from replying to the message, opting to take proactive
steps to prevent it from escalating further. She confided in her parents,
sharing every detail.
"We'll take care of everything, sweetheart," they assured her, their words
carrying the weight of her trust and love. Yet, their hushed and concerned
tones left her feeling uneasy.
Still, she tried to dismiss it as her imagination running wild.
"Instead of worrying, why not take action? Okay, Charlotte! We won't let
this get us down. We've faced worse and survived, right?" The young lady
gazed at her reflection in the mirror, talking to herself with a determined
look and narrowed violet eyes.
"Mom and Dad are doing their part, and I'll conduct my secret
investigation. This stalker, whoever they are... they won't get away with
this!"
Her pep talk had a remarkable effect. In moments, her smile returned, and
her face brightened. If this person thought she would crumble in fear and
anxiety, they were dead wrong.
She would ensure they regretted invading her privacy!
One thing Charlotte had learned from dealing with people, even those like
her current stalker, was that showing vulnerability was dangerous.
Being resolute. Being proactive. Those were the rules of the game.
And I'm going to win! With a confident nod to herself, Charlotte went on to
freshen up for school.
In all honesty, traces of fear and doubt still lingered within her. However,
these were simply echoes of her past trauma.
Determined to do her utmost best to not let a complete stranger dictate her
life, she donned her trademark smile and officially started her day.
______________________________________

"Hey, guys! Good Morning!"
Charlotte Olivia entered the classroom, offering greetings to the handful of
students present.
The room, decorated in a simple black-and-white palette, felt oddly eerie in
its emptiness. Charlotte wore her signature, bright smile, but deep inside,
she longed to drop the pretense and reveal her true emotions.
"You're earlier than usual today," Sofia remarked, her eyes gleaming
with curiosity. She had been one of Charlotte's earliest friends in this
school.
"Yeah, Sofia. Thought I'd change things up a bit," Charlotte replied,
her gaze wandering around the spacious room. The absence of students only
made it seem more vast.
Despite feeling guilty about not being honest with Sofia, Charlotte chose to
keep her troubles to herself.
"Really? That's cool! How does it feel, then?" Sofia's enthusiasm
radiated from her as her slightly tousled blond hair seemed to dance with
excitement. Her lively personality and cheerful voice naturally drew the
attention of the other two people in the room.
Noticing their gazes, she lowered her voice.
"Oops, sorry about that!" Sofia's voice rose again, accompanied by a
giggle.
Charlotte let out an exasperated sigh, her fatigue almost etching itself onto
her face. She couldn't tell if Sofia's energy was genuine or an act anymore.
While she usually found Sofia adorable, she struggled to handle her bubbly
persona in her current state.
"Hey, Noah, Ben. Good morning," Charlotte greeted the two other
students in the classroom.
"Morning," Noah replied, his voice distant, his eyes fixed on the book in
his hands.
On the other hand, Ben's face brightened as he enthusiastically exclaimed,
"Morning! I'm so glad you made it early!"

Even though it was only the third day of school, Charlotte had consciously
made an effort to connect with almost everyone around her.
For example, Noah Louis sat right beside her, so it felt natural for them to
be acquainted—at least in her view.
As for Ben Elias, despite the whole fake name debacle, they had managed
to maintain a mutual understanding that led to occasional conversations.
Just yesterday, they had discussed their theories about who might be behind
it all.
While talking about classmates behind their backs wasn't ideal, they were
determined to solve the mystery as quickly as possible.
Fortunately, Ben was a reasonable and logical person who had offered his
assistance, even though his plan hadn't produced significant results.
Charlotte considered keeping him close as an ally, given his dedication.
However, given the recent stalker incident, she had to approach everyone
with a hint of suspicion, without any exceptions.
But Ben doesn't fit the profile. From our conversations, I know that much.
Besides, I've been observing him since our first encounter, just like everyone
else. He's the "honors student" type, popular among both boys and girls due
to his good looks.
It was hard to imagine him as her stalker.
Noah, on the other hand, seems more suspicious. He's a quiet person who
also happens to sit beside me. But would a stalker be so obvious? Well,
there was the concept of hiding in plain sight.
Charlotte couldn't be entirely certain of the facts, so she had to assess
everyone without bias, including her dear Finnish friend, Sofia.
Sure, Sofia had an extroverted personality, but Charlotte didn't sense any
malice in her. Besides, she had encountered people like Sofia in the past.
Definitely not their style.
Charlotte's greatest advantage was her wealth of experience in
understanding people. Through sufficient interaction and observation, she
could easily decipher someone's true character.

That was why she felt confident in her ability to investigate and ultimately
expose the mastermind behind the fake name incident and now the ongoing
stalker problem.
As Charlotte continued chatting with her lively friend on the way to her
assigned desk, a thought crossed her mind: What if the stalker and name
faker are the same person?
Suddenly, her heart raced, and tiny droplets of sweat formed on her face.
The closer she got to her desk, the more intense her unease became. It felt
like a dreadful itch at the back of her throat, accompanied by a queasy
sensation in her stomach.
"Are you okay? You look really pale," Sofia, her perceptive friend,
noticed Charlotte's sudden discomfort.
"Oh, it's nothing," Charlotte tried to brush it off, but she couldn't hide it
any longer. Just a glance at her desk and chair filled her with more than just
discomfort; terror began building as well.
‘Why is this happening to me again?’ she wondered silently.
"Are you sure? Your seat seemed to make you uncomfortable," Sofia
persisted, making Charlotte wince in surprise.
‘Seriously, why did she choose the worst moment to be observant!’
"I-I'm fine," Charlotte managed to croak, feeling her heart sink as she
lied. How could she expect everyone to be honest if she wasn't honest with
them herself? The sting of hypocrisy made her almost sigh.
"Well, actually—"
"Excuse me, you're distracting me," Noah suddenly interrupted their
friendly exchange, his gaze slightly irritated.
"Oh, sorry," Charlotte apologized instantly. She caught a glimpse of his
translucent glasses as he adjusted them, and then he returned his attention to
the book on his desk. He acknowledged her apology with a nod, though.
See? He couldn't be the stalker!
Drawing from her past experiences, Charlotte knew Noah's character well.
He was a bookworm, an introvert who preferred to keep a neutral stance
with everyone, as long as they didn't disturb him.

‘Or is he pretending?’ She asked herself.
"Let's go to your seat to talk. We still have about twenty minutes before
class starts," Charlotte suggested to Venla, who nodded eagerly.
Both girls left Noah to his academic solitude. It was clear that a chatterbox
like Sofia wouldn't be welcome in the presence of someone who craved
silence. Charlotte understood this, and so did Sofia.
“Sure. Let’s.” And so, they moved to Sofia's seat for a more
uninterrupted conversation.
Why do I feel relieved now that I'm moving farther away from my seat? Why
did I feel so uncomfortable earlier? Charlotte knew the answers all too
well.
Yes, she had done her best to mask her fear with confidence and
determination, but deep down, that primal instinct continued to torment her.
Until she found the stalker, it would gnaw at her relentlessly.
I need to wrap this up... and fast! Charlotte thought.

______________________________________

“She's all by herself now, and it’s break time. Should I go and talk to
her?" John's voice was a soft whisper, barely audible to anyone but himself.
His attention was fixed on Charlotte Olivia, who wore a serious expression
as she operated her tablet. John felt a sense of pride, knowing that he had
taught her that useful trick. At least, that was what his expression conveyed.
"She didn't even greet me today. Her eyes seem distant too..."
When John entered the classroom, he found Charlotte engrossed in a
conversation with Sofia, a lively classmate from Finland. The Charlotte he
knew would typically prefer staying in her seat. However, he managed to
deduce a few potential reasons for her decision to sit with Sofia.
"Noah doesn't like to be disturbed, so she decided to have the
conversation elsewhere. Haha..." A faint chuckle escaped John's lips, a
smirk of amusement playing on his face.

Charlotte's temporary departure from her usual spot didn't bother him too
much. It actually allowed him to get a good view of the seat he longed for.
"Grandfather told me I should make a friend to achieve that. So, I guess
I should start with the only person I've actually spoken to." John thought,
realizing that he felt quite lonely.
While everyone else had begun forming groups, John hadn't made a single
friend yet.
Despite a few people like Ben attempting to start up conversations with him
—or at least he thought they had—unluckily, he always seemed to need the
bathroom at those very moments. John couldn't help but wonder why he
sometimes tended to overindulge in things, like eating too much chocolate.
Nevertheless, he reassured himself that it was only the third day, and he still
had time to connect with others. Looking at people like Noah, who
appeared just as solitary, gave him comfort that he wasn't the only loner in
the class.
"Lately, I've been getting a lot of stares, though. And I overheard
something earlier about me being the 'name faker.' Maybe I misheard it."
Being a mere spectator was proving to be difficult.
Even when he didn't do anything, trouble seemed to find him.
"Could this be the work of the true culprit? Or is it mere speculation? I
wonder..."
But how could he blame his classmates for pointing fingers at him? In their
eyes, he was likely the odd one out. He rarely socialized, often talked to
himself, and would leave the class whenever someone approached him. All
these strange coincidences made him appear suspicious, didn't they?
Thankfully, he hadn't done anything to confirm or disprove their suspicions.
However, he knew that staying neutral like this couldn't last forever.
Sooner or later…
John's gaze returned to Charlotte. He truly wanted to talk to her and become
her friend, just as his wise grandfather had advised.
Now, during break time, was his perfect chance! What was he waiting for?

"She's not talking to anyone right now. It's the perfect opportunity!"
John beamed, impressed by his cleverness. His timing was impeccable, and
he wasn't going to let this chance slip away.
"I'm really going to do it!"
Determined, John prepared to approach Charlotte. His body shifted in the
chair, muscles tensing as he mustered the strength to stand. He was almost
there, on the cusp of achieving his goal...
But wait! His mission was thwarted as he spotted another boy intercepting
his target.
“A-ah! That is...”
A surge of disappointment washed over him, and he remained seated, his
plans slipping away.
As it turned out, someone else had beaten him to it.
"H-hey, aren't you going for brunch, Charlotte?"
The boy's face glistened with sweat, his fingers trembling, and his gaze
avoiding direct contact. His Adam's Apple bobbed as he swallowed, and his
legs seemed frozen in place. Even this seemingly confident guy appeared
overwhelmed by Charlotte's magnetic presence.
Does he have a crush on her? John wondered, his curiosity piqued.
The boy's name was Leonardo Lorenzo, and the rosy tint on his cheeks
hinted at more than just innocent intentions. There was definitely something
brewing between him and Charlotte... or so John thought.
I'm not sure. Not enough information... but...
Uncertain, John narrowed his eyes and smirked. Observing their
interactions proved to be quite fascinating. Perhaps, for now, he could find
satisfaction in playing the role of a spectator.
Sadly, their conversation was cut short. The flustered student received a
gentle rejection from Charlotte, as expected. However, he left with his sense
of self-worth intact, even appearing happier than before.
Charlotte had a remarkable ability to convey her thoughts using words and
gestures that evoked positive emotions in others. Her rhetoric was

impressive, even if it relied on subtle tricks that went unnoticed by her
targets.
None of these observations escaped John's notice, making him wonder if he
could also be influenced by her charm, that is, if he wasn't already.
As his thoughts drifted, John glanced around the classroom, noting a group
of popular girls preparing to leave. They had quickly formed a tight-knit
clique within just a couple of days, their influence spreading rapidly.
They were led by Mia Elena and their expressions of scorn were all directed
toward a specific target: Charlotte.
It seems Charlotte isn't paying attention to them. She's too engrossed in her
tablet. Or so it seems. There were subtle signs that indicated her lack of
attention to her current activity.
To anyone who closely observed Charlotte, it was clear, or perhaps it was
just him.
She's actually watching the class. Why? John didn't want to stare too much,
but his curiosity got the better of him.
The moment he looked at her, though, he felt a funny sensation.
"Ah, my tummy."
John stood up, leaving his seat behind as a stronger sense of duty took hold
of him—the undeniable call of hunger.
"I need to grab something to eat." With measured steps, he made his
way out of the classroom.
Satisfying his hunger became his top priority. It was a more appealing
prospect than bothering with questions to which he likely had answers.
______________________________________

Mia and the other girls were glaring at me a moment ago, weren't they?
Charlotte kept her eyes fixed on the tablet she was fiddling with.
Despite appearing indifferent to her surroundings, that couldn't be further
from the truth. Her violet eyes discreetly scanned the classroom, leaving

brief pauses between each observation, creating the impression that she was
merely engrossed in her tablet.
By doing this, she hoped to keep the mastermind from suspecting that she
was actively investigating them. So far, she had been closely observing her
classmates and had some potential suspects in mind.
Of the twenty-four students, not everyone had a good relationship with her.
A few had even gone as far as ignoring her greetings and friendly gestures.
But that wasn't the sole criterion she used to gauge their guilt.
After playing out various scenarios in her head and making efforts to act
naturally around everyone, she began to notice several things. Apart from
Mia's group of girls, who remained openly hostile, Charlotte had managed
to interact with the other students.
Well... almost all of them.
Alisa tends to doze off a lot during and even after classes, making it hard to
talk to her. Even now, Charlotte could spot her sleeping. Han Soo also
doesn't seem eager to talk. He's always absorbed in his games, thanks to
those ever-present headphones, and whatever he's doing seems incredibly
important, so I don't want to disturb him.
She made exceptions for a few others too but continued observing them
from a distance. However, her observations confirmed her suspicions.
None of those individuals seemed to have a genuine interest in her.
They were either too busy, too distracted, or simply too exhausted to harbor
any motives involving her. It didn't make sense for them to be the stalker.
So, what about the ones who did show an interest in her?
Gabriel is always striking up these random chats with me. It seemed
suspicious at first, but he talks to plenty of other girls too. Besides, he's got
this major ego thing going on, always blabbing about himself.
It doesn't match the stalker's behavior.
Others like Yusuf, Daisuke, Mikail, and Christopher also seemed different
in their approach. They displayed a moderate level of interest in her, but it
felt purely platonic.

In short, they seemed like genuinely nice people.
Mikail seems a bit overenthusiastic, but that's probably his personality.
Kind of like Sofia...
Then there were those who seemed to have stronger motives. People like
the boy who had recently asked her out to lunch.
I feel a bit guilty for turning down Leonardo. Should I have accepted his
offer? Maybe I could have observed him more. No. It's better this way.
It would only worsen her guilt if she had led him on, pretending to be
interested, just for the sake of her investigation.
She let him down gently, though, so it shouldn't be too bad, right?
Leonardo Lorenzo was generally friendly with everyone in the class, but he
mainly interacted with the boys. This was the first time he had initiated a
conversation with her, though they had exchanged messages by email.
He memorized my email address from the very first day and messaged me
after class. What a sweet guy. The way he blushed and tried to win her over
revealed his true feelings.
He wasn't usually shy, so Charlotte concluded that he was genuinely
captivated by her, to some extent at least.
"What a mess," she sighed.
She didn't consider herself proud or sassy, and she wasn't claiming he had
feelings for her out of self-satisfaction. But the truth was, she had a knack
for reading people.
Besides, she had been asked out by guys multiple times. She was
intelligent, beautiful, and approachable. It was only natural that guys would
fawn over her, as her past experiences had shown.
After all, we're teenagers in high school. It's not a big deal.
Unfortunately, she didn't feel the same way about him. Hopefully, they
could at least become friends. That was permissible—no, desired—by
Charlotte's standards.
‘At least I know he's not the stalker. He's too honest,’ she thought, relieved.

The same couldn't be said for the girls who didn't seem to like her very
much, led by Mia Elena, who had recently started antagonizing her.
Despite Mia's unpleasant attitude, Charlotte didn't believe she could be the
stalker. I've met girls like her in the past, so I have a sense of her
personality. If Mia had that information, she'd probably go for something
way more... extra.
If Mia got her hands on those recordings, Charlotte could say goodbye to a
normal high school life—just another reason she needed to hurry with her
investigation.
There were a few other people she had her eye on, one of them being the
loner of the class—her prime suspect.
John Lenard... could it be him?
She glanced in his direction as he stood up to leave the class. His black hair
swayed slightly, and his bright smile radiated goodness and innocence. He
held his stomach as he left, suggesting he was headed to either the
bathroom or the cafeteria.
So far, he seemed harmless. But Charlotte wasn't easily fooled by
appearances alone. While the boy likely hadn't noticed, she had been
silently observing everyone in class, including him. She had noticed how he
openly watched the students, especially her, which was a classic sign of
creepy behavior.
Still, she couldn't rely solely on that observation. The fact that John was
smart enough to figure out the tablet and seemed uninterested in finding out
who was behind the fake name incident made him even more suspicious.
Maybe he's not the culprit, but possibly involved? Charlotte shook her head
slowly, sighing at her baseless assumptions.
What am I thinking? I'm jumping to conclusions. He's just a suspect at this
point.
Sure, he looked kind, cute even, but she couldn’t trust anyone. Her
experiences had taught her that even the nicest people often had ulterior
motives.
Even back then…

She shook her head, stopping herself from dwelling too deeply on what had
just crossed her mind.
He's probably off to grab a bite, so I'll just keep an eye on him later. I
should have most of my answers by the end of today, and...
DING!
Charlotte's tablet chimed softly, just enough for her to hear the sound but
not disturb her neighbor, and the vibration sent a tingle through her
fingertips. Her heart began to race for no apparent reason, and her eyes
snapped to the screen.
N-no, not again!
Her violet eyes widened, and she found herself trembling. The screen
displayed a message from the same person who had occupied her thoughts
all day.
It was—
Good afternoon.
Did you have a good night? I did. It’s nice seeing you fiddle around with
your tablet. Won’t you have something to eat? Just saying... Also, check this
out.
Trust me, you’ll regret it if you don’t.
>Image File<
—Anonymous!
H-He... no way… Charlotte's heart raced, pounding faster than ever. She felt
sweat forming on her soft, delicate skin, her throat growing dry, and a lump
forming there.
The school's tablet was a versatile gadget, used for everything from emails
and internet surfing to games. Mobile devices could even be synced with
the tablet. It was a convenient tool, eliminating the need for carrying extra
devices to class. It was more than enough.
But now…

“N-no…” Charlotte muttered, her world slowly falling apart as she
stared at the downloaded image. Her vision blurred, and a wave of tension
sent a chill through her feet, making the hair on her skin stand on end as if
the room's temperature had dropped below freezing.
A picture of me... from downstairs... how? She glanced out the window, her
eyes fixed on the lush flower garden, radiating with beauty.
The photo must have been taken by someone with an impressive camera
lens. The angle was spot on, capturing a lovely image of Charlotte, seated in
all her grace.
But when was it taken? Think, Charlotte! Her eyes focused on the image,
zooming in to examine every small detail. She soon noticed the blurred,
pixelated background.
Wasn't this when Mia and the girls were leaving? That's when this picture
was taken. But by whom? Charlotte could just make out Mia's blond hair
and her group behind her. This single image narrowed down her list of
suspects.
John couldn't have taken it; he was still in the classroom. The girls are also
in the picture. Leonardo? No, he left the classroom just before this was
taken. It would have taken him at least two minutes to get downstairs and
set up for a good shot. Charlotte had been keeping a close eye on the
garden, and she'd have noticed any sudden movements.
In the classroom, a handful of students remained, while the majority had
left for a break. Unfortunately, many of the individuals she suspected had
come back. The uncertainty about the photographer's identity and how they
had pulled it off left her feeling overwhelmed.
They picked the exact moment I was focused on Mia and her crew, trying to
stay low-key. What do I do now?
This single image left her more puzzled than when she began her
investigation.
Things were slipping out of her control, and her head throbbed as she
considered the possibilities. She no longer felt safe in her seat, but her legs
trembled so much that her buttocks felt glued to the chair.

S-should I tell the school? Maybe they can help. Yes, it's a risk, but keeping
quiet will only make things worse.
Charlotte wasn't naive. Such disgusting acts thrived in secrecy. If she
exposed the culprit, then—
DING!
Another notification interrupted her train of thought. It sent shivers down
her spine, but Charlotte bit her lip, summoning the courage to take the
necessary step and confront the source of her current discomfort.
What do you think? I give it a 10/10. You look nice in it. Oh, and there's
something else we should talk about. It’s about something you said.
That was the end of the message, leaving Charlotte even more confused.
The stalker's way of communicating was strange and perplexing.
"What did I say?" Charlotte wondered aloud.
"I just asked a question, right? Unless... have I already talked to them?
Maybe they're referring to that. Maybe I spoke to them without realizing it,
that would make sense." As she thought it over, Charlotte considered the
possibility that the culprit had an accomplice.
While the accomplice remained in the classroom, they could have taken the
picture. In that case, John became the primary suspect.
What are the odds that right after he left, I got this strange message? He
hasn't come back yet. He could be the anonymous sender, using someone
else to take the photo.
Charlotte felt herself becoming overly paranoid, but desperation was taking
over. The whole situation was pushing her to the edge.
"But why? Why would John..." Charlotte whispered to herself, only to
notice the boy entering the classroom. He looked just as he did when he
left, seemingly cheerful and innocent. However, Charlotte's perception of
him had shifted dramatically.
Speak of the devil!
She pretended not to pay attention but watched him closely. He was
carrying two paper food bags, and she couldn't help but wonder why it took
him so long to have his brunch, only to return with so much food.

It only added to the mounting evidence pointing to John as the culprit.
He had spent more time tormenting her and getting that photo than on
anything else. Maybe he had needed a bathroom break, but she couldn't
bring herself to consider that possibility.
That's probably what he wants me to think! Her head throbbed with pain,
but she locked her gaze on him, determination etched into her expression.
Yet, her resolute look soon gave way to a helpless sense of worry.
Why is he coming towards me? Was he about to say something, about to
reveal himself?
Charlotte felt herself growing more tense. She longed to rise to her feet and
escape, to run far away from the impending danger that threatened the life
she had envisioned for herself.
However, she found herself paralyzed with fear, unable to stand.
Petrified, she endured the overwhelming despair of watching someone so
vile draw closer. Her vision blurred, and she felt as if she might pass out
when...
"Charlotte, I bought this for you. I noticed you hadn't eaten anything all
day, so I thought I'd get something extra for you."
H-huh...? To say she was surprised would be an understatement. Charlotte
had expected something creepy and terrifying, yet she was met with
warmth.
John reached out, holding one of the paper bags that definitely contained a
simple meal for her.
"I initially bought just for myself, but then I remembered you and had
to go back. Haha!" He chuckled, seeming a bit awkward but genuinely
caring.

Charlotte's heart swelled with mixed emotions, and her anxiety slowly
eased. Had she been wrong all along? Accusing John was already a stretch,
but could he be innocent?
NO! He's probably doing this to cover his tracks! I can't trust him.
Was it just a coincidence that the stalker had stopped texting now that John
was in the class? Charlotte doubted it. By using kindness to hide his true
intentions, did he really expect her to remove him from her list of suspects?
N-no... in fact, this only makes it more suspicious. I need to...
DING!
DING!
Two new notifications flashed on Charlotte's screen, instantly sending a
shiver down her spine. They were unmistakably from Anonymous.
"Um, Charlotte... you don't want it?" The boy standing before her asked
innocently, his head tilted to the side.
He was undeniably cute, no matter how you looked at it. Sure, he was a bit
of a loner, but was that reason enough to suspect him?
Moreover, the real culprit had just sent a message—no, two messages. How
could he possibly be the same person as John, who was standing right in
front of her?
"Ah, sorry about that, John. Thanks a lot," she said, accepting the meal
with a hint of hesitation, not wanting to be rude.
If he turned out to be innocent, her actions would be unfairly unjustified.
But wait, what if his accomplice is the one texting me now? If they are
working together, then it’s possible that… no, what am I doing?
Wasn’t she making even more assumptions now?
It felt like she was somehow desperate to pin John as the stalker, even
though, just like her other classmates, he didn't fit the profile.
Charlotte figured it was better to absolve John of any blame. In the first
place, focusing on a single culprit required fewer assumptions and greater
leaps in logic.

"No problem. Enjoy your food," John said, flashing a broad smile that
eased some of her tension. He returned to his seat immediately, opened his
paper bag, and pulled out a chocolate parfait and a vegetarian meal set.
As he started to savor his meal slowly, Charlotte found herself lost in the
moment, observing as he ate with the innocence of a child.
How could she have thought someone like him was terrible?
Maybe he's just like me, she thought.
She opened her own meal set and discovered that he had ordered the same
thing. Inside, she found a handwritten note.
I don't know what you like, so I got the same stuff I enjoy. I hope that's okay.
And if you're still bothered about the 'fake name' incident, don't let it bother
you too much.
You'll definitely catch the culprit.
Honestly, it didn't match the style of someone creepy. She noticed the
roughness of the handwriting but admired its unique charm.
Gradually, everything started to make sense.
John must have been genuinely concerned about her ever since she had
shared her concerns about the mastermind with him. Given how much time
she spent on her tablet, it made sense that he paid close attention to her. He
had even taken it upon himself to keep an eye on the class, perhaps in hopes
of finding a clue about the real culprit.
In a way, John was looking out for her best interests, yet she had unfairly
labeled him as a creep.
The more she thought about it, the more guilt crept in. As she took a bite of
the well-prepared fruit and vegetable salad from the vegetarian meal set,
she began to feel better. And the chocolate parfait was an even sweeter treat.
Culprit or not, John certainly had excellent taste in food.
DING!
Startled, Charlotte realized she had been neglecting the emails from
Anonymous when she heard the third notification sound. Quickly, she
opened her tablet and saw the three messages he had sent.

One was;
Can we talk?
After, it was;
It’s very important.
Then it became much worse.
Listen to this. Let’s see if you can ignore me afterward.
>Audio File<
Charlotte, feeling much better after John's kindness, decided to entertain
Anonymous' desperation by listening to the mysterious audio file he had
sent. She had already made up her mind to bring this matter to the attention
of the school authorities. She was confident they would handle it better than
she ever could.
After all, this was Richardson Elite Academy!
‘I'll give the audio file a listen and download it for safekeeping,’ Charlotte
thought to herself, a mischievous grin lighting up her face. ‘Having some
evidence wouldn't hurt. And if it's the stalker's voice, even better!’
Charlotte imagined the cutting-edge technology the school could use to
analyze the voice and the surrounding sounds. She knew that investigations
often employed advanced tools to unmask individuals behind cyber attacks.
While she didn't know the specifics, she was certain they could track down
the person behind the voice.
As Charlotte downloaded the audio file, she eagerly plugged in her custommade school headphones. "Alright, let's see what you have to say, you cree
—"
But as soon as the first word reached her ears, Charlotte's amusement faded
away.

Her hand, trembling, abandoned the salad she was holding, and a bitter taste
instantly filled her mouth.
Unease churned in her stomach, instantly stealing away her appetite.
No. No. No. No. This can't be happening! Nooooo... How?! Charlotte's wide
eyes twitched, and a fresh sheen of sweat formed on her face.
The more she heard the voice, crystal clear in her ears, the more certain she
became.
She was listening to herself, her voice.
Instead of worrying, why not take action? Okay, Charlotte! We won't let
this get us down. We've faced worse and survived, right?
Her chest began to ache as she listened further.
Mom and Dad are doing their part, and I'll conduct my secret
investigation. This stalker, whoever they are... they won't get away with
this!"
How was this even possible?
I was definitely alone in my room this morning! I’ve always been. How did
he even—? How? I don’t understand… how?
At that moment, panic surged through Charlotte. She clutched her head
tightly, her body shivering uncontrollably. Seeking solace, she bent her head
under her desk, tears welling up in her eyes.
The brave and strong girl who had vowed to fight and conquer was slowly
crumbling under the weight of it all.
DING!
Driven by instinct, Charlotte couldn't resist checking the message.
She had to know.
I know all about your interesting chat with your parents, Charlotte. They
promised to handle it, didn't they? Let's see how far they'll go.
You can inform your school authorities too, but trust me, they won't be able
to save you. Nothing can stop me.

Remember, Charlotte, we're friends, right?
M-Monster! Charlotte gritted her teeth, unable to hold back any longer.
Overwhelmed with desperation and anxiety, she frantically typed her reply
on her tablet, her fingers trembling. She felt like she could faint at any
moment, and the meal she had enjoyed moments ago now felt nauseating.
Stop this! What have I ever done to you? Just leave me alone!
For a moment, silence hung heavy, as if the stalker had received her
message loud and clear.
Charlotte hoped with all her heart that it would end the nightmare. She
couldn’t take it anymore.
"P-please, just leave me alo—"
DING!
"No..." A whimper escaped her lips as she checked the reply, feeling
crushed and defeated.
You finally replied!
As friends, aren't we supposed to talk to each other? I understand you're
busy, so I won't expect too many replies.
But remember, if you dare breathe a word about me to anyone—your
parents, teachers, or friends—everyone will know who you truly are.
Anger surged within Charlotte, momentarily overshadowing her fear. In the
heat of her rage, she responded with seething frustration and burning hate.
I won't give in to blackmail! Do your worst! Tell everyone! I don't care
about these people. I barely know them.
Do whatever you like.
She didn't want things to escalate like this, but she could bear the
consequences. It was far better than being manipulated by a sick pervert.

DING!
I had a feeling you'd say that.
But you need to understand, it won't just be your classmates who know. All
those foundations, and social groups—everyone will find out.
And if that's not enough, I can make sure they know exactly where to find
you. Remember how badly things turned out last time? Either way, I win.
As long as you get that, you'll cooperate.
“Eek!” Charlotte slumped, defeated.
A part of her shattered. She finally realized her helplessness against this
enemy. It felt like a cruel joke to suspect someone from her class. Now that
she thought about it, it could be a senior or even someone from her past
who now worked at the school.
It could be anyone.
DING!
Let’s have a wonderful time together, Charlotte. I hope you enjoy your
class.
Watching you like this is the only way I can get close to you. If you don’t
mind, I’ll keep sneaking shots of you in class. Your serious face is always
adorable.
Even now, the way you're frowning, your expression twisting in helpless
anger, disgust, and anxiety... It's so captivating.
Oh, and if you need any help, just let me know. Okay?
Atta girl!
From their brief conversation, Charlotte made two major conclusions. Her
body shook, her mind raced, and she felt trapped in a whirlwind of despair.
But her thoughts wouldn't stop, continuously trying to make sense of it all.

As she scanned the classroom, almost everyone had returned, except for
Ben Elias and Sofia. They were beyond suspicion. John and the rest of the
class were there, focused and not distracted by their phones. Everything
pointed to a logical answer.
The stalker couldn't be the same person as the one behind the fake name
incident. The culprit wasn't even in Year 1B.
But the second conclusion troubled her even more. Not only did the person
record her in her room, but they also knew intimate details about her past
and could share it with others. They even watched her during class. It
seemed unlikely that it was a fellow student.
Could it be a teacher or someone with authority and access to confidential
information? This realization ruled out John and everyone else as suspects,
but it also revealed a darker, more sinister truth to Charlotte—a truth that
sent shivers down her spine and made her accept the grim fate that awaited
her.
"I... I can't beat this..."
Not this time.

CHAPTER 5
THE OFFER
As a general rule, people are not necessarily willing to suffer detriment to enter heaven, but a man
will pay any price to escape hell.
______________________________________

The High School Cafeteria was usually buzzing with activity during break
periods and closing hours, and since it was currently break period, it was

crawling with students.
Situated in a separate building adjacent to the main classroom building, it
stood right before the sprawling general library. The cafeteria itself
resembled a massive hall, a whole building dedicated to catering to the
students' culinary needs. It boasted fancy chairs and tables, inviting every
student to savor their meals. Some opted to grab their food and go, while
others chose to sit and enjoy the ambiance.
As students maneuvered through the bustling lunchroom, most of them
moved in groups. Even though it was only the fourth day of school, both
new and returning students could be seen mingling with their respective sets
of friends, although a few still preferred solitude.
The cafeteria was a melting pot of students from all grades, ranging from
fresh-faced newcomers to experienced seniors.
The service section of the cafeteria was divided into various sections, with
each staffed by professionals ready to prepare whatever the students
desired. With their efficiency and the multitude of choices available, the
cafeteria services operated at lightning speed.
Just like everything else on campus, payment was made using the students'
ID cards, and so far, there hadn't been any issues—well, at least none that
they were aware of—since the beginning of the school year.
Despite the crowd, a sense of order prevailed within the cafeteria, although
the sound of chattering and conversations still filled the air.
Still, wasn’t this much was to be expected from high schoolers, elite or not?
Among the students waiting in line at the different counters, a particular
first-year boy seemed overwhelmed by the variety of meals.
His short, dark brown hair shifted as he kept looking at the options, his
green eyes wandering around the hall unintentionally. He sensed the food
service worker's gaze and adjusted his glasses before speaking.
"Elaborate.”
An exhausted sigh followed the uncomfortable pause between him and the
worker. Even though there was no one waiting behind him, so there was no

rush, the worker's frustration stemmed from a different issue—the boy just
couldn't make up his mind.
"The menu is right on the device in front of you. You can pick from the
preset items or customize your meal. We have a wide range, so it should be
easy to find what you like. If you have any allergies..."
Richardson Elite Academy had a modernized system, so it wasn't surprising
that each cafeteria counter had tablets displaying the available meal options
and extras. The cafeteria worker had explained this before, but the
bespectacled boy still struggled to decide.
What was causing him to take so long to make a choice?
"Um... Elabora—”
"Mind if I pick something for you?" a voice chimed in from behind the
indecisive teenager.
The voice was strong and deep, coming from another first-year student who
was already quite popular in their class. With his auburn hair and gray eyes,
everyone in the class could easily recognize him.
"Sure, Ben Elias."
"Haha, come on, Noah. I've asked you to call me Ben. Anyway, leave it
to me!" Ben, Year 1B's rising star, gave a confident and charming smile.
Noah Louis, the indecisive boy, found himself at a loss for words. He just
nodded, surrendering his decision-making to Ben. Maybe it was his
imagination, but the moment he agreed, he could almost hear a sigh of relief
coming from behind the counter.
————————————
"What's up with you, Noah? You couldn't decide back there? You're
usually quick in class," Ben asked while serving himself some potatoes.
Both guys had found a table for two in the bustling cafeteria. It wasn't too
hard to find a cozy spot amidst the many options. As they settled in, Noah
couldn't help but wonder why someone like Ben had chosen to sit with him
instead of his usual group.

Normally, he'd hang out with the other boys, right? Not to mention the girls
who are warming up to him. Noah half-expected Ben to do something
different and not sit with someone as low-key as himself.
But without any clear explanation, Noah decided to focus on his mouthwatering meal instead.
It was a treat for the senses—hot, steamy potatoes with a tantalizing sauce
and a mix of delicious spices. Assorted meats and sausages added a perfect
balance to the dish.
The stew's aroma was amazing, and he couldn't resist the sausages and
savory pieces of meat on his plate. A medium-sized carton of milk, along
with some water, completed his well-rounded meal.
Ben sat across from him, his lunch choices similar to Noah's, except for the
juice box and an extra water bottle on his tray.
"I'm not used to ordering food, that's all," Noah replied, keeping it as
straightforward as Ben. He took a bite and his eyes widened with delight.
This meal exceeded his expectations.
"What do you think? Delicious, right?" Ben asked, pointing his fork
towards Noah.
Noah didn't need words to express his satisfaction. A nod conveyed how
much he enjoyed the meal.

"You seemed a bit lost earlier, and you just mentioned that you're not
used to ordering food here. I also haven't seen you in the cafeteria since the
first day of school. Don't tell me... you've never been to the cafeteria?"
Ben's gray eyes widened, filled with astonishment.
Once again, chewing kept Noah from answering, but another nod confirmed
the truth.
"But why?" Ben inquired.
To answer Ben's question, Noah thought about his usual routine—eating in
his dorm before rushing off to class and spending the break period
immersed in reading, either in class or the library. He never felt the need to
spend much time in the cafeteria. However, he wondered if he should share
his true thoughts with the boy in front of him.
I overslept today, so I didn't get a chance to eat before leaving. My stomach
was growling, and I couldn't focus on my reading, that's how I ended up
here.
It was his first time in the cafeteria, and the sheer size of it nearly
overwhelmed him. Finding his way to the counter was one challenge, but
navigating the menu while processing everything else proved even more
difficult. Still, Noah believed he would have figured it out eventually.
The cafeteria worker just caught me off guard, that's all.
"I prefer to use my time wisely. Lingering here for too long eats away
precious time. Our conversation right now proves that." Noah explained,
reaching for his milk as he spoke.
"Well, you have a point there. But don't you think you'll miss out on
opportunities to socialize if you don't take advantage of this place?" Ben
smiled, poking one of his sausages with his fork. "I mean, look around you,
Noah. This place is a goldmine for making friends."
As Noah glanced around, he saw the truth in Ben's words. Amid the vast
hall filled with students, it was rare to spot anyone alone.
They were either engaged in lively conversations with friends, sharing
laughter with classmates, or forging new connections. He did spot a few
students eating in silence, and Noah appreciated that. He wished more
students would adopt such courteous behavior.

"Huh? Isn't that..." Noah's eyes narrowed as he noticed a group of his
classmates. It consisted of six girls, but it seemed like five of them were
surrounding a single girl who appeared nervous, tears streaming down her
face.
Sofia Venla? Why is she crying? And those girls... they're smiling?! Noah
even noticed one of the five girls, a girl with beautiful blond hair and a
clear, radiant face. With her lovely skin and graceful demeanor, he instantly
recognized her as Mia Elena, the rising Queen Bee of their class.
If Ben could be considered the most popular among the boys, Mia was
becoming increasingly influential among the girls. However, as a bystander,
Noah realized a stark contrast in their approaches.
"Ah, I'm sorry you have to see that. This isn't the first time it has
happened, you know..." Ben sighed, a hint of sadness in his voice as he
continued eating his potatoes.
It was clear that he didn't feel good about the situation, but he wasn't willing
to intervene. Noah couldn't blame him either, as he also didn't want to get
involved. Dealing with such a troublesome matter would only be a waste of
time.
But still... we're only in our first week, and she's already resorting to
bullying? Noah knew he couldn’t accuse Mia and her friends outrightly.
Despite appearances, there was no concrete evidence. For all they knew,
Sofia could be shedding tears of joy, or maybe they were just teasing her,
and she became overly emotional. Regardless, there were many possible
explanations, so there was no need to dwell on the issue.
They could easily deny it, and nothing would happen. Noah sighed and
decided to focus on his meal.
"In any case, Noah, you should really visit the cafeteria more often,"
Ben's voice chimed in again, gentle and friendly.
"Why should I? So I can see more unpleasant scenes like that?" Noah
pointed at the group of girls, five of whom were now laughing. Sofia Venla
was still wiping away tears, trying to force a smile that looked strained and
unnatural. The bespectacled boy couldn't bear to watch any longer and
averted his gaze.

"Well... not exactly. It's just better for you that way," Ben's words made
Noah's body tremble slightly.
He couldn't explain why, but Ben's last statement felt harsh, almost
threatening. However, when Noah glanced at Ben, he appeared completely
at ease, enjoying his meal with utmost pleasure. Nothing about him seemed
intimidating.
Or at least, not anymore.
This sudden shift in emotions cast a dark cloud over their conversation.
Noah pretended he hadn't noticed anything and continued eating, hoping the
conversation would just come to an end.
"By the way... what are your thoughts on the whole fake name
incident?"
Unfortunately for Noah, the conversation veered toward a topic he didn't
want to discuss. Until now, he had managed to stay under the radar, so why
was he being asked about it?
"I don't really have an opinion. Why exactly are you asking me?" Noah
tried to brush it off, but Ben's knowing smile made it clear that he wouldn't
let it go so easily.
"You know, after observing for a while, I've hit a dead end. Honestly, it's
starting to seem more likely that there's no name faker at all. I was
thinking... maybe Charlotte made a mistake and—"
"Who knows? Personally, I don't want to get involved," Noah shrugged,
taking another sip of his milk.
Why bother him with all these useless details anyway? All he wanted was to
study and excel in the school. I don’t need any unnecessary baggage.
"Come on, don't be like that. You're really smart, aren't you? Just give
me some clues so we can wrap this up. Even though people might not be
talking about it, they're actually pretty freaked out."
"I'm not," Noah shrugged.
"W-well, you're an exception..." Ben almost let out an awkward laugh,
quickly apologizing.

‘Why does he want to know what I think? Why doesn't he just work with
Charlotte or any other brilliant person in class? It's not like I'm special or
anything,’ Noah thought, but he also realized that Ben would probably keep
bothering him.
Isn't that the real reason he wanted to talk to me here? He's quite concerned
about this incident, isn't he?
Scoring social points by uncovering the name faker seemed like a fairly
reasonable motive, didn't it? Of course, Ben would never admit that he
wanted to steal the spotlight, but Noah figured his intentions were along
those lines.
You’re so obvious, anyone can see it. Noah couldn't help but smile a little,
finally deciding to speak up.
"I believe the name faker exists. But, I also think they won't be a
problem. I don't understand why everyone's making such a fuss. Give it a
couple of weeks, and they'll eventually be exposed."
"Ohhh! Why do you think so?" Ben asked, his eyes widening with
curiosity.
"This is an all-inclusive school. We'll be working on group activities
and exercises. The school should have records of all the students' names,
right? Even the teachers. Basically, anyone with enough access to the
system should be able to see our real names," Noah explained, shrugging.
As time went on, they would probably have a designated leader responsible
for coordinating team tasks. Wouldn't it be natural for that leader to have
access to the roster? In the end, it was inevitable.
"I feel like it's only a matter of time before the name faker is exposed.
We just need to be patient."
"Now that you mention it, you might be onto something. There's no
need to rush, after all. Acting rashly would only create unnecessary
tension."
"Exactly," Noah nodded, adjusting his glasses as he took another bite of
his potatoes.

"Thanks, Noah. You've been really helpful. Honestly, you should speak
up more often." Despite hearing this, Noah didn't feel compelled to change
anything. His goals remained the same, and nothing would alter them.
"Whatever..." he muttered, looking away to distract himself.
His gaze wandered in the direction of another classmate. This classmate
stood at the counter, next to a girl. Although the girl wasn't from their class
and seemed older, the boy appeared much younger.
With dark hair, blue eyes, and an innocent smile on his face, he chatted
freely with the girl, and it seemed they were ordering something together.
Something about their unusually friendly interaction intrigued Noah,
enough to make him forget about the previous topic on his mind.
After all, he knew this boy quite well in class. He wasn't one to attract much
attention and was practically the class loner.
I thought we were alike, but I guess I was wrong.
"Oh? Isn't that the boy from our class? And he's talking to a senior too?
Wow, he must have some nerve. See, Noah, this is what I'm talking about—
making friends, forging connections!" Ben interrupted Noah's thoughts,
once again using his charismatic tone.
"Yeah, you have a point there..." Noah responded wearily.
"What a sharp kid. What’s his name again? He hardly interacts in class, I
can't even remember." Ben stroked his chin, momentarily closing his eyes
in an attempt to recall.
"John." Noah's response was quick, and his gaze shifted away from the
boy the moment he spoke.
"His name is John."

Charlotte sat alone, her fingers dancing across the keyboard as frustrated
sighs punctuated her work.
"I can't believe I have to resort to this," she muttered.

Though she had enough space to work, she couldn't shake her discomfort in
this unfamiliar environment she was using for her research—for both
school and her other activities.
The reason behind her unease was simple. Richardson's had an incredible
library, and this computer outperformed her own in terms of specs. But...
Charlotte sighed again, unable to find her usual rhythm.
She stopped typing and stared blankly at the screen. It held only four
meager paragraphs, far from enough to meet her goals.
I can't continue like this. But what choice do I have?
Since that fateful Tuesday evening when her online stalker first reached out
to her, Charlotte's regular school life had vanished. Although the stalking
was relatively recent, the constant feeling of being observed, recorded and
photographed had steadily sapped her happiness.
It's Thursday, and I have to submit this project by Friday. Charlotte had
never once missed a deadline before, and she couldn't afford to start now.
The school had already closed for the day, but Charlotte remained, driven
by the urgency of her current task.
She anxiously recalled that it had been a long while since she had failed to
accomplish a task. As someone who always aimed to be a reliable
contributor to any group, Charlotte was unwavering in her determination to
excel. She understood that her actions could affect the whole group's
performance, and she couldn't risk falling short, even if others were
slacking.
Although it demanded a great deal from her, she genuinely enjoyed what
she did, and it was never a burden—until now.
I can't use my tablet or any other device without worrying that the stalker
might snoop on me. This... this is the only way I can get some privacy and
feel safe.
Charlotte knew she couldn't outsmart the stalker, so she decided to tough it
out until her parents could figure something out. Going to the school
authorities would only make things worse. It went against her principles to
cave into the blackmailer's demands, but Charlotte couldn't risk making
them even angrier.

‘I just have to hang in there for now,’ she thought with determination,
clenching her teeth as she got back to typing.
Although the working conditions were less than perfect for her, Charlotte
had no real reason to complain. This was, after all, the library of the most
prestigious academy for gifted students, wasn't it?
Indeed...
Inside the grand halls of Richardson Elite Academy, an impressive
collection of outstanding facilities awaited. These structures far exceeded
what you would find in a regular high school. But that is what you would
naturally expect from the top school for exceptionally talented individuals.
Even though there were all these extraordinary things, there were still some
typical high school features that Richardson Elite Academy shared with the
regular ones.
One prime example was the General Library.
Every high school year had its own classrooms and specialized buildings,
but the library was a shared space for all students, regardless of their grade.
It was located in a separate building, standing proudly apart from the fivestory classroom block.
This four-story wonder was a treasure trove of knowledge, offering
resources on a wide range of subjects. The ground floor served as a central
hub where students could explore various information beyond the regular
school curriculum, covering topics suitable for all educational levels.
Moving up to the upper floors, the sight was incredible. Each of the first,
second, third, and fourth-year sections had its designated floor. The first and
second years shared the first floor, while the older students had their
assigned floors.
The library's size rivaled that of a public one, packed with books tailored to
the academy's students' educational needs. To keep up with the times, they
also had an e-library section, complete with audiobooks and digital
documents. Each desk was equipped with a fully functional computer to aid
in the quest for knowledge.
"This place is amazing," even Charlotte had to admit, unable to conceal
her impression as she marveled at the interior design, the harmonious blend

of black and white, and the room's minimalist layout. It truly created an
environment that encouraged focus and productivity.
She sat on the first floor, deeply engrossed in her computer instead of
diving into a physical book. Most students around her were equally
absorbed in the digital world, although a few still found joy in flipping
through the pages of paperback books.
The air conditioning provided a pleasant hum, spreading a refreshing breeze
through the room. Surprisingly, the ambiance was quite nice.
As it was shared with second-year students, Charlotte had expected a
cramped and chaotic space. However, the seating was well-spaced, and the
number of students present wasn't overwhelming. Charlotte couldn't help
but think that even if all the first and second-year students were in the
library, there would still be enough room for focused studying without
feeling suffocated.
To be fair, this place was perfect for quiet research or dedicated study.
Charlotte wondered if she would have appreciated it more if she wasn't
currently burdened with stress. The thought lingered in her mind.
While she generally preferred the solitude of her private space, working
alone in the comfort of her room, she had no aversion to public facilities
like the library. Still, it just didn't offer the same ambiance.
"I really need to address this," she muttered to herself, momentarily lost
in her thoughts. Suddenly, a group of girls rushed past her seat. Typically,
she would have been too absorbed to pay them any attention, but one of
them carelessly bumped into her chair, jolting her back to reality.
"Hey!" Charlotte blurted out in a hushed tone. Her day had taken a bad
turn, and now she had been rudely knocked forward by a stranger who
didn't even bother to apologize.
"Oh, sorry. I didn't see you there," the girl's familiar voice filled the air.
It was the same group of girls she had been dreading. By the time Charlotte
realized who they were, it was too late.
‘Why now?’ she wondered, suppressing her annoyance. Her heart pounded
as she felt a wave of unease. Goosebumps formed on her skin as the whole
group of girls turned their attention to her.

"Well, well, if it isn't Charlotte. Haven't seen you here since we started.
First time?" the girl at the center of the group, Mia Elena, asked with a
haughty tone and a condescending gaze.
Her blond hair exuded elegance, adding to her charm. Despite her
contrasting personality, her stunning beauty had the power to captivate
anyone, making them overlook her many flaws. A wicked grin spread
across her face as she asserted her dominance, drawing closer to Charlotte
with her group of friends.
"Come on, I asked a question. I wonder who's being rude now..." Mia
enjoyed the moment, her friends joined in with a slight chuckle, affirming
her amusement.
"Well, firstly, I never said you were being rude. Secondly, I don't recall
hearing your apology for bumping into me while passing..." Charlotte's
response was swift and precise. Her voice remained calm, but her message
carried a firm undertone, enough to knock the confidence right out of her
adversary.
"Well, isn't that—"
"Lastly, maybe you should consider the location we're in. This is the
library." With narrowed eyes, Charlotte aimed to make her point clear to
Mia. Whether Mia was perceptive enough to take the hint was another
matter entirely.
"Tch. Whatever. Come on, girls," she said, smirking.
And just like that, Mia decided to back down. The sound of her retreating
footsteps echoed loudly, leaving Charlotte with the impression that she
wasn't too pleased.
Well, that went well... A sarcastic thought crossed Charlotte's mind as she let
out a sigh. She wished resolving her current predicament was as simple as
dealing with bullies like Mia. Unfortunately, a stalker with access to her
private information presented a far more formidable challenge than a high
school student seeking validation from her entourage.
Charlotte noticed she had drawn too much attention, with many unfamiliar
eyes on her. Some students were from her year, while others appeared to be
seniors, identifiable by their more mature appearances.

‘I would have liked to interact with some of them, but…’ At that moment,
she felt completely drained of social energy. Moreover, time was slipping
away, and she had only a few hours left before her project's deadline.
I can't leave this place until I'm done. It'll take a few more hours, so I'll
return to my dorm in the evening. The thought of walking alone to her room
sent a slight shiver down her spine. Sweat trickled down her face, making
her feel lightheaded. Her computer screen blurred, and a sharp headache
throbbed as she fought to regain her composure.
Security at Richardson Elite Academy was impressive, but Charlotte
couldn't find it in her to trust the school any longer. A relentless stalker had
violated her privacy and committed illegal acts with the sole purpose of
tormenting her. The sense of safety she once took for granted now felt
shaky.
If one tormentor was haunting her, who's to say there wouldn’t be others?
What if the same stalker went on to harass someone else? The mere thought
sent shivers down her spine.
Anonymous has made it clear he's only after me, but there could still be
other victims. The thought alone terrified her. If she had to endure the
horrors of her past all over again, what was the point of breaking free from
her shell and embracing a normal school life?
Why did I even come here if this is how it's going to be? Charlotte bit her
lip, realizing how deeply she had fallen into despair. An unsettling mix of
fear, anger, hopelessness, and determination churned in her stomach,
leaving her on edge. She couldn't quite figure out her jumble of emotions,
but one thing was clear—she had to take action.
I... I have to do something! Charlotte's determination surged within her.
Time was of the essence, and she needed to act quickly.
______________________________________

"That stupid bitch!" Bursting forth was a voice that carried both irritation
and an oddly sweet tone. The anger in her voice was clear, but the blonde's
elegance remained intact, even as crass words poured from her lips.

"She thinks she's so smart? I'll teach her a lesson. That stupid little miss
perfect."
Mia Elena and her group of friends were on their way to the dorms when
she started venting her frustration. She unleashed her anger on a stone pillar
by the curb, kicking it with force and yelling at the same time.
The other girls in Mia's group stayed silent, allowing her to release her
frustration on the helpless pillar. While her outburst troubled some of them,
they chose not to interrupt.
Ida Sofia, Lara Jacobs, Marie Felix, Alicia Beatriz, Grace Ellie, Anne
Rowena, and finally Lolade Oladeinde. A few others were missing, but
these seven girls were Mia's closest companions. However, their supposedly
close relationship with Mia had loosely defined boundaries.
Firstly, each girl understood their place in the hierarchy. While they were
friends with Mia, it was not an equal relationship. They didn't have the
authority to criticize unless specifically asked.
The second reason for their silence was more compelling. Mia Elena's true
self was nothing like the somewhat vulgar persona she displayed at that
moment.
Mia exuded class and prestige. She could be condescending and arrogant, as
her mood demanded, but she also had enough charm to win over those she
talked to. Besides, her family's influence made it nearly impossible for
anyone to oppose her.
By connecting with people based on shared values and common interests,
Mia had secured the loyalty, or at least the allegiance, of the girls around
her.
"That Charlotte... she doesn't realize it yet, but I'm winning." Her
scowl gradually turned into a satisfied smirk as she took deep breaths to
calm herself, bringing relief to her friends.
"She thinks cozying up to everyone will earn their trust and loyalty?
How naively foolish can she be? I'm going to undermine her completely."
Her group of girls nodded in silent agreement, their expressions of approval
giving Mia the confidence boost she needed.

This isn't enough, though. No, it's just the beginning. First, the girls, then
the boys, and soon, the whole class. Charlotte Olivia wouldn't even realize
when the entire class became Mia’s.
"I'm curious, though. Why don't you like Charlotte? Is there
something specifically wrong with her?" one of the girls, Lolade, asked.
Lolade, whom everyone just called Lola, with her ebony skin and coiled
dark brown hair, stood out among the group. Her innocent curiosity
demanded an answer, and although Mia wasn't obligated to respond, she
found herself speaking up.
"There's nothing wrong with her. She's actually perfect. I'm sure she
would make a great leader and ally." Gasps filled the air as Mia's admission
caught everyone off guard.
"N-no way..." Lola's jaw dropped dramatically, indicating her shock.
"Hmph!" Mia ran her fingers through her blond hair, grinning
confidently at the bewildered girl.
"T-then why are you—"
"Because I'm the same, and there can't be two of us standing. One of
us has to lose before the other can take complete control." Mia's lips curled
into a confident smirk.
"A-ah..."
"It's nothing personal. I just want to lead the class and she's in my way.
Consider my efforts against her as a kind of honor. I wouldn't bother
challenging her if she didn't pose a threat to me."
Somehow, Mia's last statement carried a deeper implication beyond just her
rivalry with Charlotte. Her intense gaze pierced the hearts of her audience,
evoking both fear and greater admiration.
It was as though she was saying, "You all don't pose a threat to me, so I
choose to take you under my wing. But the moment you become threats, I
will destroy you."
Understanding this instantly, Lola nodded nervously, thanking Mia for
answering her question.

"It's no problem at all, Lola. You can all feel free to ask me questions
as well." Mia made sure to lock eyes with each of the girls as she spoke.
There was no hesitation, fear, or anger in her eyes. Her expression was
surprisingly friendly, showcasing her sweet side. It was almost intimidating.
"After all, we're all friends, right?"
The girls watched as their leader gave a cheerful smile. The pristine beauty
and charm that radiated from her, highlighted by her pearly white teeth and
the tilt of her head, captivated them. Seeing Mia go to such lengths to show
her sincerity, they had no choice but to respond in the only appropriate way.
"O-of course. We're friends!"

______________________________________

Friday morning started like any other school day for John. The air buzzed
with the lively chatter of students who had already formed their social
circles, alongside a few loners who preferred solitude. Just like any high
school classroom, it held a mix of different personalities.
Among the cheerful, carefree, serious, and anxious faces, John tried to
maintain a cheerful demeanor. After all, one was never fully dressed
without a smile.
However, something caught John's eye: a certain person was missing from
their usual seat, and it was already time for Homeroom. Given his
familiarity with his classmates and the usual routine, this was highly
unusual. The absentee was not known for being late.
Whispering with his hand covering his face, John asked, "Where's
Charlotte?"
Worry crept into his voice as he looked at her empty seat, wondering about
her whereabouts and trying to solve the mystery.
In a few moments, the teacher would arrive to take attendance and share
some words of encouragement, if any. The importance of attendance in
grading was still uncertain, so missing it seemed careless. Even the least
motivated students managed to make it to homeroom on time. So, why was
Charlotte absent?
"Good morning, students. Please settle down and be quiet. I have an
important announcement," Mr. Matthias Archibald declared as he entered
the classroom, dressed in his usual white shirt and black trousers, complete
with a dark tie that slightly altered his laid-back style.
John watched his homeroom teacher closely and sensed something was
different. Mr. Archibald's smile remained, but his gaze seemed more
intense, making John feel uneasy. The teacher's eyes scanned the room,
focusing on each student — an unusual behavior.
I wonder what changed. John thought, puzzled by the change in his
teacher's demeanor.
The classroom fell into an eerie silence as their teacher surveyed them.
Panic started to creep in among the students. Some had sweaty foreheads,
while others were simply shocked, rather than frightened. The quiet,

nervous teenagers began to wonder if this was another surprise test or an
impromptu exercise.
John, too, was worried.
"What's happening?" he whispered, his gaze returning to Charlotte's
empty seat. Countless thoughts raced through his mind, but one seemed
more likely than the rest, especially with Mr. Archibald's presence.
Charlotte did you really…? John's thoughts trailed off as his attention
shifted back to his teacher, his eyes filled with curiosity and concern.
The notion of a surprise test seemed plausible, but the fact that their
classmate, Charlotte Olivia, was absent on the same day raised doubts for
John. It was difficult to accept as a mere coincidence. His mind couldn't
help but connect Charlotte's absence to whatever was about to happen.
"Come into the classroom," Mr. Matthias instructed, turning toward
the entrance. The door opened, and to John's surprise, Charlotte walked in.
A wave of relief washed over him, clearly seen on his face, as Charlotte
made her entrance.
John let out a heartfelt sigh. He must have been worried that Charlotte
might have been late, affecting her grades in a possible test, or perhaps he
feared something might have happened to her, and the teacher was there to
announce it.
The worst-case scenario flashed in John's mind — Charlotte transferring to
another school.
That would be devastating, and John realized how much he would miss her
presence. Her dark brown hair and captivating violet eyes had always
caught his attention. However, something was different today — her usual
confident smile was missing.
Charlotte took her place beside Mr. Archibald, sparking whispers among the
students. The desks were spaced a meter apart so it was challenging to
engage in side conversations, likely the reason for the hushed murmurs.
"What's happening?"
"Is Charlotte in trouble?"
"Is this serious? Mr Archibald is involved, after all..."

It had only been a week since they all met, but Charlotte had quickly
become a noticeable presence, capturing attention whether people intended
to notice her or not.
Now, with her standing right before them, looking unlike her usual self,
everyone began to speculate about the situation.
John scanned the room and noticed one of his classmates who appeared to
be genuinely concerned about Charlotte. This classmate had a somewhat
unruly hair, and his unwavering gaze showed his worry.
"Leonardo Lorenzo, huh? The same guy who talked to her that one
time..." John shifted his focus to another student.
This one had a completely different reaction. Her eyes burned with hate, but
a cocky smile remained on her face. John couldn't help but think that she
completely disliked Charlotte, and her curiosity was piqued by Charlotte's
proximity to Mr. Archibald.
However, Mia had to maintain her public image as the embodiment of
confidence and grace, so she kept that fake smile plastered on her face.
"Is Mia worried that Charlotte might have reported her?" John
wondered. It was clear to him that Mia didn't have much fondness for
Charlotte. She always tried to undermine Charlotte when she made
important statements and frequently glared at her, accompanied by meanspirited comments.
Wasn't it absolutely clear at this point? Even yesterday, when John was in
the library with a senior, he witnessed Mia intentionally bumping into
Charlotte. It was obvious that she saw herself as a rival to Charlotte.
Even though it wasn't John's concern, wouldn't it be fair if the kinder of the
two girls decided to report Mia's behavior to Mr. Archibald? The immediate
consequences might not be too severe, perhaps just a public apology would
be enough.
"But does she have any evidence?" John mused. However, considering
Charlotte's influence in the class, he believed it wouldn't be hard for her to
gather a few witnesses who could support her claims. If certain conditions
were met, everything could fall into place, and Charlotte could come out on
top.

Despite all of this, though…
I don't think she'd stoop that low. John thought. Charlotte is completely
focused on bringing the class together. Her current goals don't give her a
reason to directly confront Mia right now.
Despite Mia's snobbish attitude and unpleasant personality, she still held
some influence over the class. She had her group of friends, and some boys
were smitten with her. John had seen his fellow guys admiring her, so he
knew how much Mia meant to them.
If Charlotte took such a bold action, it would only create more conflict. She
might win in the short term, and the immediate consequences might be
minor, but things would become exponentially difficult afterward. Based on
what John had observed, he didn't believe Charlotte was the type to engage
in such pettiness.
Humans are multifaceted, and their actions are often driven by various
factors, including their immediate motives and goals. When people aim to
make friends, they typically make an effort to be as friendly as possible.
However, their behavior can be influenced by a multitude of factors, such as
the desire to portray a particular image, and conflicting motivations and
desires.
John understood these intricacies, so he had some insight into Charlotte's
motivations.
With this understanding, he realized it was highly unlikely for Charlotte to
directly confront Mia, especially involving a teacher.
Regardless of who Charlotte truly is on the inside, she has shown a genuine
desire to get along with everyone. Her goal is to unite the class and ensure
it functions smoothly. Everything she has done so far gives credence to that
assertion.
John felt confident in his conclusion. Nevertheless, he didn't need to think
much further to understand that this probably had nothing to do with Mia.
There’s something else going on...
Mr. Archibald was about to reveal it anyway, so John decided to stop
speculating and listen.

"Charlotte has expressed discomfort with her current seat, and she
would like to change positions with a classmate. As you all know, each seat
has been assigned to a specific person. This arrangement will continue until
you move up to the next year and so on."
John noticed that their homeroom teacher was getting straight to the point.
Mr. Archibald probably wanted to wrap things up quickly because
homeroom only lasted ten minutes. Now, they had only nine minutes left.
"Wait, I asked to switch seats to sit with my friends, but you didn't
allow it."
"Yeah, me too."
"I wanted to sit beside... well..."
As expected, students had various excuses to switch seats, and John was
already familiar with many of them.
During the first three days in the classroom, some students had tried to
swap seats to be closer to their friends or crushes, while others simply
wanted to escape their current neighbors. Unfortunately, all requests had
been denied.
John understood their situation, as he faced the same predicament, although
he never asked the school for a seat change. Unlike his classmates, he knew
it would all be pointless since the rules were pretty strict, and his minor
reasons wouldn't be considered. Just wanting a better view of the blue sky
or the beautiful garden outside wouldn't cut it.
"You're right. The school doesn't usually make exceptions to this rule,
but Charlotte's situation is different. I can't share the details, but don't
worry; her request won't affect your autonomy as students. We'll still follow
the rules."
John nodded in agreement. Many students would likely be irritated if they
had to give up their seats for Charlotte without knowing why.
He wouldn't want anyone in the class to face such a difficult situation, not
even Charlotte herself. Giving her special treatment could damage her
reputation and social standing.

Unfairness and preferential treatment toward an individual, even if it
doesn’t harm the rest of the group, are frowned upon the most by a
collective.
Charlotte had worked hard to build a strong and trustworthy reputation. The
school's willingness to make an exception for her alone, while disregarding
others, had the potential to dent her image. If the school forced someone to
give up their seat for her, things could get even worse.
In a volatile high school environment, loyalties can change quickly. People
who were once indifferent to Charlotte might start to ignore her in favor of
defending or avenging a friend or acquaintance.
John realized that in this social setting, the situation had become more
complicated than a simple seat swap.
Bonds had been formed, rules established, and perceptions created. If
Charlotte disrupted all of that with a single exception, it could have a much
larger impact than just the seat change.
"In essence, the school is allowing her to change seats. However, the
choice is up to you, at least for the person willing to give up their seat for
her."
After Mr. Archibald's statement, the room fell silent. Students exchanged
uncertain glances, and some had guilty faces. Those who felt that an
injustice was being done seemed determined not to give up their seats.
Others were undecided, and some simply ignored the situation.
John was unsure as he looked around. No one was volunteering to swap
seats with Charlotte, not even those who were close to her. Even Sofia
Venla, who John thought was a friend, appeared determined not to give up
her seat. He wondered why she would make such a choice. Weren't they
friends?
Perhaps it has something to do with Sofia's conversation with Mia in the
cafeteria. They seemed to get along well, even laughing together...
John shifted his gaze to another person.
Not Leonardo Lorenzo either. No, he seemed incredibly hesitant, and for
good reason.

All his friends were his neighbors. Who in their right mind would want to
trade such a convenient position for an isolated spot next to the window,
with the weirdo in glasses as their immediate seat partner?
On the other hand, Mia looked rather pleased and mischievous. Was she
planning to take advantage of Charlotte's current vulnerable social
situation? Only she knew.
John scanned the faces of his classmates, hoping someone would step in to
help Charlotte. Then, he saw her.
Charlotte looked visibly shaken. Her violet eyes pleaded for assistance, her
furrowed brows revealing deep concern. She kept glancing at the unwanted
seat, her trembling knees showing her unease. Her lips quivered.
John could sense it. Charlotte was genuinely willing to give up her seat for
one primary reason.
FEAR!
"I..."
Was there any reason to hesitate? He wanted the seat, right? In addition, a
classmate needed his help. The most rational choice was to accept the
conditions and —
Not yet…
______________________________________

No one, huh?
After a few seconds of silence, Mr. Archibald turned his gaze towards
Charlotte and shook his head. He appeared disappointed by the class'
response, and a hint of sadness dimmed the corners of his eyes.
He noticed the student next to him trembling despite her efforts to hide it.
As an educator, it pained his heart to witness such a sight, but he knew his
hands were tied. Rules were rules, and he couldn't do more, both due to
regulations and concern for Charlotte's school life.
"Well, then, I suppose this is rather unfortunate," muttered Mr. Matthias
Archibald almost under his breath as he looked at the twenty-four seated

students.
"In case you change your mind, you can still choose to—"
"I... I'll do it!" Suddenly, a voice erupted from what seemed to be the
center of the classroom.
Almost every student turned their eyes in the direction of the voice. It
sounded masculine, yet somewhat innocent. The person in question stood
up, of average height, but with features that could be described as cute.
Mr. Archibald, along with many other students, expressed surprise at this
last-minute decision. The teacher broke into a relieved smile, genuinely
pleased to have found a volunteer.
However, the most significant reaction was from Charlotte. Her widened
eyes showed not only shock but also a spark of hope.
Finally, someone had come to her rescue!
______________________________________

Haa. I actually did it... John's eyes seemed to say as he looked at Charlotte's
shimmering violet eyes.
He genuinely believed they were beautiful. The innocent look on her face,
as she was rescued from whatever troubled her about the seat, warmed his
heart.
While Charlotte was still too shocked to speak and on the verge of tears,
John noticed her lips moving in response to his heroic act.
Her glossy lips parted, and she silently mouthed words meant for his eyes
alone: Thank you, John.
______________________________________

"Both of you can switch seats now, but remember, this is temporary.
Each seat has been assigned to a specific student," Mr. Archibald explained.
The concept of having a designated spot in a public setting brought comfort
to everyone.

However, as an exception to the rule, Charlotte would switch seats with the
brave volunteer for their next class until the transfer process was completed.
"John and Charlotte, please come to my office during the break. I’ll
need both of you to fill out a form and show your Student IDs to finalize the
transfer and update the class database," Mr. Archibald instructed.
The two students nodded in understanding. John gathered his things - his
tablet and headphones - from his desk and slowly moved to the seat next to
the window. The intense stares from his classmates made him uneasy.
"Eeep..." He let out a soft sound.
Fortunately, he quickly settled down. Placing his tablet on Charlotte's wellorganized desk (since he couldn't access the inner compartments due to
unfinished paperwork), he sighed with relief, having only moved a few
meters from his previous spot to his new one.
From the corner of his eyes, he saw Charlotte leaving the front of the class
and approaching his desk. Before sitting down, her eyes briefly darted in his
direction, and then she settled in.
"Now that we have that settled, let's get on with Homeroom," Mr.
Archibald said, interrupting the sudden interest in the class loner and the
most popular girl, as well as the speculation about their connection, and
redirected their attention to another important matter.
"Time for attendance. Oh, but before that..."
Perhaps it was just the students' imagination, but there was something
different about their teacher's smile. There was a slightly darkened glint
within, which could be seen as mischievous or, more concerning, a warning.
"Tomorrow is Saturday, your first weekend after resumption. There's
something very important you all should know. There will be a special class
tomorrow, and your attendance is mandatory." Mr. Archibald paused, letting
his statement sink in.
"What?!"
As expected, the students didn't take the news well.
"We've got just over five minutes left of homeroom. It'd be great if you
could keep it down and hear me out without making a scene."

The whole class, at least the sensible ones, wore gloomy expressions on
their faces.
It was Saturday, the weekend when everyone craved relaxation after a
demanding week. Sure, Richardson Elite Academy didn't give an
overwhelming workload, and the classes were manageable. They started
early and ended early, with ten-minute breaks after each lecture. But even if
school wasn't too challenging, teenagers had their limits.
Wasn't it common sense that Friday marked the start of a blissful weekend,
a break from the struggles of school life? Some students had made plans for
the weekend. How could this bombshell be dropped out of nowhere?
"The special class begins at 9 AM sharp. I'd suggest getting there
early," Mr. Archibald stated with finality.
Groans escaped from the students, but their complaints fell on deaf ears.
"9 AM on a Saturday?"
"That's the price of an Elite Academy. No rest!"
"What's next? Sunday classes too?"
"Shh! Don't jinx it, you fool."
"Sorry."
Mr. Matthias casually ignored the students' grumbling as he focused on his
tablet-like device to take attendance.
Richardson Elite Academy had a tech-savvy approach to attendance. The
teacher simply glanced at his tablet, matching names with faces on a digital
list to mark attendance. It saved them the hassle of shouting out names and
seeking confirmations.
Unfortunately, this method also made it difficult to find the culprit behind
the fake name incident. Most students only used their tablets during class
for note-taking or interactive exercises. The true potential of the tablets
beyond academics remained a mystery to most.
Mr. Archibald's gaze shifted between his device and the students as he
marked the digital attendance sheet. It might have seemed unnecessary
since it was obvious everyone was present, but his dismissal of the students'
questioning looks made it clear they were wasting their time.

"It's better to let it go," some students said, though a hint of bitterness
still lingered.
"This is awful..."
"How will I survive today?"
"Our movie plans are ruined."
"I wanted to explore the campus tomorrow. What a shame."
"We can do it after the special class. It won't last forever, right?"
"Don't get your hopes up."
"True, true..."
The classroom was filled with a lingering sense of dread. The usual TGIF
excitement had disappeared, and the mood had taken a negative turn that
everyone could feel.
Even after attendance was taken, some students still had tears on their faces,
while others pretended not to care. Who in their right mind wanted to come
to school on a Saturday, especially young teenagers in an exciting new
environment? They should be out having fun, not cooped up in a classroom.
There were a few exceptions, though. Despite the frustration felt by most of
the students, a few faces managed to retain their smiles.
Mia Elena was one of them, appearing unfazed by the announcement. Ben
Elias had a similar demeanor, though his smile wasn't as obvious as Mia's.
And then, there was one more person who seemed unconcerned, probably
because she was fast asleep.
People around her might have thought, "What a weirdo!"
No one bothered to wake her up. A person sleeping right in front of the
teacher, in the very first row, didn't deserve any mercy. But that was Alisa
Viktoriya, always doing her own thing.
Surprisingly, she stirred slightly when Mr. Archibald made the
announcement, suggesting that the sleeping beauty, if she could be called
that, wasn't completely unaware.
"That's it for today. You have about two minutes before your first class.
Get ready... oh, and Charlotte and John, remember to come to my office

during the break," Mr. Archibald announced, ignoring their weak
acknowledgments.
He smoothly left the classroom. His calm and casual demeanor might have
seemed unusual for an educator in such a prestigious institution, but that
was the least of their concerns.
Now, everyone's thoughts shifted to a more pressing issue, something much
more distressing than the Charlotte incident.
"This is ruining my Saturday!"
"Everything's messed up!"
"We had plans for so much fun!"
And just like that, the remaining two minutes of homeroom slipped away.
______________________________________

"Thanks, John. I really appreciate it," Charlotte said with a grateful
smile, nodding as they prepared to meet their homeroom teacher for the seat
swap.
Standing next to John's former seat, which would soon be Charlotte's, they
took advantage of the break while most classmates enjoyed their free time.
The other students paid them little attention, casting curious glances
occasionally.
In a regular high school, things might have been different, but in this
competitive environment for the best of the best, nobody bothered with
individual students, as they were preoccupied with their own concerns.
John's unaffected smile conveyed his nonchalance about the matter.
"Haha, no worries. You should thank Mr. Archibald," he replied,
bobbing his head in his usual enthusiastic and endearing way. His dark hair
swayed, and his honest blue eyes sparkled with sincerity.
Charlotte couldn't help but scold herself for doubting him. Not only did he
agree to the seat switch, but he also didn't fuss about it. Her thoughts were
filled with gratitude and a hint of guilt.

Unlike the judgmental stares from her peers, John's gaze held only sincerity,
a refreshing change.
"Yeah, he made sure to announce it to the whole class. I'm relieved the
school made an exception for me. It's taken a load off my shoulders,"
Charlotte replied, her eyes darting towards her old seat by the window. An
uneasy feeling washed over her, but she concealed her emotions as best she
could, despite the chilly sensation in her body.
"True, but he also diverted the class' attention from your issue."
John's comment caught her off guard.
"Huh?" she asked, her face showing her confusion.
‘What's he getting at this time?’ she wondered.
"Think about it. By addressing your seat issue first and then bringing
up the special class we'll have tomorrow, he shifted the class' focus from
you to a more pressing matter. He made them more concerned about the
class," John explained.
"Oh..." Charlotte's eyes widened as she grasped Mr. Archibald's
strategy.
People tended to forget things that didn't directly affect them, but when
presented with a more interesting topic, they paid attention. By introducing
a more compelling issue, one with greater significance, Mr. Archibald had
redirected everyone's attention.
"Oh, my!" Charlotte gasped, suddenly realizing the brilliance of Mr.
Archibald's announcement. John's insight was spot on. Her classmates,
herself included, had been too caught up with the special class
announcement to dwell on her special treatment.
"It's amazing how you picked up on this so quickly," Charlotte said,
impressed and grinning broadly.
"I'm quite observant. It's one of my charms," John replied with a
growing smile.
"Is that so? Well then, John Lenard, what's your take on this upcoming
special class?" Charlotte asked, raising an eyebrow. Her expression was a
mix of genuine curiosity and playful teasing.

Almost instantly, a few eyes turned in their direction. They belonged to the
students who had chosen to stay in the classroom during the thirty-minute
break. Most were absorbed in books, one was snacking, and there was
Alisa, the habitual slacker from the front row, sound asleep. Fortunately,
this wasn't a regular occurrence during classes, or it would have caused
problems for her.
"Well, I guess we can continue this conversation while heading to Mr.
Archibald's office. Break time doesn't last forever, right?" John raised his
finger in mock protest, mirroring Charlotte's teasing tone.
"Yeah, you're right. Let's go," Charlotte replied, aware of the curious
glances from their classmates. She decided it was best to exit the room, with
John walking beside her.
While they strolled down the hallway, Charlotte wondered if John had
noticed the sudden attention they received when the special class was
mentioned.
Did some of their classmates know something they weren't sharing? And
what about John himself?
She glanced at his clear, unassuming eyes, observing how they effortlessly
moved as they strolled down the hallway. She wondered what he truly
thought about the school, their fellow students, and even herself.
Just what goes on in your head, John?
______________________________________

Richardson Elite Academy stood as an immense fortress of knowledge.
It came as no surprise, considering it was founded by one of the world's
largest foundations. With such backing, the school spared no expense,
resulting in a sprawling campus that boasted state-of-the-art facilities.
However, when it came to the High School, the staff offices were
conveniently located within the same five-story building as the classrooms.
It didn't take much thought to understand the reasoning behind this
arrangement.

By keeping the staff, academic or otherwise, close to the students, the
school prioritized accessibility, time management, and maintaining control
over the gifted teenagers under their care.
"Charlotte, what do you think?" John's question took Charlotte by
surprise.
They had left their classroom and were now descending the stairs, heading
to their homeroom teacher's office on the ground floor. During their walk,
John had divulged his thoughts on the upcoming special class.
"Another exercise? I had a feeling, but I never expected it to be like
this..." Charlotte replied, struggling to find the right words to answer her
new acquaintance.
They now stood a short distance from the beautifully tiled stairwell on the
ground floor, facing a crossroads. The path straight ahead led to the garden,
while the left and right sides led to the staff offices. The walls, adorned in
white, blue, and black, perfectly matched the monochrome tiles, creating a
stunning display of marble floors glistening like diamonds.
A mere glimpse was enough to leave anyone breathless.
Despite the stunning architecture of the five-story building and the option to
explore the staff offices nearby, Charlotte felt drawn to the garden right
before her. A few more steps, and she'd be through the small gates into the
outdoor sanctuary.
The weather didn't seem too sunny for late January, and a gentle breeze
brushed her skin, making her wonder if it was her imagination.
"What's on your mind, Charlotte? Are you a fan of the garden's
flowers? I can see the appeal. My grandfather actually enjoys..."
Charlotte quickly interrupted John, preventing him from saying more.
"N-no, it's not that. I actually... I don’t like them," she stammered
urgently.
She didn't want John to make incorrect assumptions. It was easy for others
to misinterpret her interest in the garden as a simple admiration for nature,
but that would be far from the truth.

It's not that I don’t like flowers, but… not this garden. Though subtle, a
slight change in her expression betrayed her true feelings.
The garden served as a painful reminder of the torment and anguish she was
enduring, crushing her hopes for a normal high school life in just two days.
This garden was undoubtedly where her stalker had taken the photo,
capturing her from a window's view.
She had diligently searched the garden for clues, but her efforts had been in
vain as if she was chasing a ghost.
How on earth had her tormentor managed to take so many pictures without
her noticing?
A quick glance to her side revealed John's curious gaze fixed on her. They
had been standing by the stairwell for a while, students passed by, likely
heading to or from the cafeteria. It was overdue for them to meet their
homeroom teacher, but Charlotte found herself rooted in place.
"Charlotte, maybe we should—" John started, but she unintentionally
cut him off. Her voice carried urgency, tinged with anxiety.
"John, you seem to know a lot about flowers. Have you been to this
garden before?" Charlotte's question broke the silence. She didn't apologize
for the interruption, her tone was serious, and her voice trembled slightly.
Maybe... just maybe, if it's John, he might notice something out of the
ordinary.
A glimmer of hope sparked within Charlotte. She eagerly awaited John's
response, with her violet eyes fixed on his genuinely puzzled expression.
"Well, yeah. I've been there twice. I explored the garden on the first and
second day of school. It reminds me so much of my home, with all the
beautiful flowers," John replied matter-of-factly. There was genuine
enthusiasm in his voice when it came to nature, and Charlotte sensed a true
passion for flowers emanating from him.
Even now, she couldn't help but analyze John, as she often did. She had
already concluded that he wasn't the stalker, but that didn't mean she
couldn't read him, at least as a classmate.

‘Maybe even... no, what am I thinking? I'm getting ahead of myself,’
Charlotte thought, shaking her head to refocus on the present.
"Did you notice anything strange about the garden?" she asked, her
curiosity piqued.
"Well, not really. I was just captivated by the flowers. This garden has a
rare purple hibiscus variety I don't have at home. I was tempted to take one
with me, but..." John's voice trailed off, and Charlotte wondered what the
"but" meant.
"I noticed security cameras. I'm not sure if taking a flower or two would
be considered stealing, and I don't want to get into trouble," he confessed,
his voice breaking slightly, a mix of nervousness and sweetness on his face.
Charlotte caught the most crucial detail in his statement. A camera?! Her
eyes widened as she considered something she hadn't thought of before.
"Could you show me the camera, John?" Her tone suddenly sparked
with excitement, catching John off guard.
"Well, I don't mind, but we really should go see Mr. Archibald now. We
don't know how long it'll take to fill out the forms, and I was thinking of
grabbing something to eat afterward, so..." John hesitated, concern in his
voice.
"Yeah, you're right. I completely lost track of time. I'm sorry for being
so insensitive, John," Charlotte gasped, checking her wristwatch to gauge
how much time they had wasted without achieving their initial goal.
"Oh, wow. It's been almost fifteen minutes into the break. We should
hurry and see Mr. Archibald," she exclaimed, scanning the doors on either
side of the hallway for any sign of their teacher.
"It seems the right side is for the teachers of Years 1 and 2. Let's go,
John." Without even realizing it, Charlotte found herself grabbing John's
hand, pulling him along as they hurried past the stairwell and through the
doorway.
"W-wait, are you sure? Are you in some sort of trouble, Charlotte? I
mean, with the camera and all..." John's voice trailed off, concern etched on
his face.

"You can show me later. Maybe after class today? Right now, let's get
this done quickly," Charlotte interrupted, her voice cutting through his
questions. With a faster pace, she urged them forward, and John, a bit
slower, struggled to keep up.
They hurried through the white-painted hallway, passing various office
windows and doors with different teachers' names. Unfortunately, their
homeroom teacher's name remained elusive.
Charlotte searched frantically for any sign of him, feeling time pressing
down on her, all while noticing John's difficulty in keeping up.
"A-ah, John!" she exclaimed, concerned.
John, less accustomed to physical exertion, had ragged breaths, showing the
strain he was under. After a few seconds of running, Charlotte realized her
actions had once again put John at a disadvantage. She slowed down and
felt guilty for her thoughtlessness.
"I'm so sorry, John. Truly, I..." Charlotte's voice trailed off, her remorse
evident.
"It's fine. Haha, I'm just a little hungry, that's all. I haven't eaten all
day," John reassured her, trying to downplay the situation. But his words
deepened her sense of guilt. He hadn't even had breakfast? Despite his
petite stature, he carried himself with strength, and Charlotte's conscience
scolded her for her lack of consideration.
"I'll make it up to you, I promise! Brunch is on me," she exclaimed,
determined to make amends. Without running this time, she quickened her
walking pace.
John's tired face transformed into an expression of excitement. The sheer
purity of his joy amazed Charlotte, and her heart swelled with admiration.
He's so adorable!
"Well, let's make sure we get the form filled out on time," John
suggested, his enthusiasm evident.
"Agreed," Charlotte replied, a warm smile on her face.
______________________________________

"Oh, there's no form needed. I just need your IDs. And sign here," Mr.
Archibald chuckled lightly, addressing his tired students, one of whom
appeared particularly exhausted.
His office, while not overly spacious, was well-furnished with a desk and
three chairs. Seated behind his high-quality desk, he motioned for the two
students to take a seat in front of him. The air-conditioned room created a
comfortable and cozy atmosphere that instantly appealed to them.
Mr. Archibald took pride in his extensive bookshelf, filled with various
books, although most of them had little to do with the subject he taught. His
office was decorated in light blue and white, resembling a bright,
welcoming sky, which he loved. This setup created a pleasant working
environment.
On his desk, there was a modern laptop and a stack of books. Behind this
setup, the teacher shared the news with his students.

"What in the...?" Charlotte's disbelief was written all over her face as she
gazed at their very handsome, yet sly teacher. "You lied to us! Do you
realize how fast we had to run to get here?"
Mr. Archibald thought he could discern the emotions behind Charlotte's
flushed face. Her unspoken thoughts were clearly echoing in her mind.
"Don't give me that look. I did what I had to do to ensure you both
would arrive here on time. I thought that mentioning a form might prompt
you to show up early, even if you weren't sure how long it would take," he
chuckled, carefree and unconcerned.
"Whoa. That's exactly what John said," Charlotte exclaimed, her
surprised gaze shifting to her partner.
"It was just a guess. Nothing special," John replied casually, his sincere
smile indicating his honesty.
John Lenard, huh… Mr. Archibald smirked and nodded.
He tapped the tablet on his desk, pushing it toward them for their
signatures. An attached stylus pen made it easy for them to complete the
task, as digital signatures were quite simple.
"Your student IDs," Matthias requested, and they obediently handed
over their identification cards, like model students. He took pleasure in
having such cooperative individuals under his guidance. After all, a
teacher's joy was incomplete without good students.
Once he had their cards, Mr. Archibald used a black and red scanner to
verify their validity. Fortunately, everything went smoothly without any
issues. Within a minute, the task was complete.
"Well, that's all. If you have any problems with your desks or classrelated issues, don't hesitate to see me. I'll do my best to assist within the
limits of my authority," he said with a warm, friendly grin, aiming to leave a
positive impression as a dedicated teacher.
"Mr. Archibald, is tomorrow's special class going to be a class
exercise?" Charlotte eagerly asked.
Mr. Matthias was caught off guard by her inquiry but maintained his
composure.

"An interesting question. Did John mention that to you?"
"Please don't answer my question with another question," she sighed in
exasperation, causing him to slyly grin. He had no intention of revealing
such classified information to students, despite the potential benefit.
"Who knows? It's not my place to say. I can tell you it's definitely
going to be interesting, though." Shrugging with indifference, his words
implied that they wouldn't get more information.
Nice try, though. His smile widened.
"Alright then. We'll take our leave now. Thanks, Mr. Archibald,"
Charlotte said, and John, being less talkative, nodded in agreement. They
collected their cards and left his office as quickly as they had arrived.
Matthias couldn't help but think, 'Not even a goodbye or have a good night?
Kids these days...' He caught himself before completing the thought,
realizing he was sounding like a boomer.
That was certainly not the image he wanted to portray. As a youthful man in
his prime, he couldn't afford to ruin the cool vibe he had going for him.
"Well, time to prepare for my next class," he grinned, packing up the
three books on his desk. He quickly glanced through them, appearing to be
doing some last-minute revision.
What a challenge. How am I supposed to get through this? As those
thoughts lingered, his motivation to continue reading dwindled. Sitting
down and immersing himself in the cool ambiance of his office seemed
much more appealing.
"Those two... I didn't expect them to become so close so quickly. It's
almost unnatural," he chuckled, the sound echoing in his office.
It seemed that instead of reading diligently, he preferred to reflect on the
affairs of others. What sort of behavior was that?
Of course, one's public image could be completely different from their true
self.
For now, the seat exchange solves the immediate issue, but Charlotte's
concerns are serious. Too serious to be ignored. As absurd as it may sound

that our security has been compromised and there's a stalker, I can't dismiss
it. It's worth investigating.
The teacher within him felt grateful, though, that she appeared to be holding
up well.
Charlotte was strong, but there was only so much a person could handle
when burdened with something so heavy.
At least, with this... Matthias thought, relieved… a part of the problem is
solved.
_____________________
"John, you really love chocolate, don't you?" This was only the second
time she'd seen him indulging in a chocolate treat from the cafeteria—the
first time being a parfait two days ago. But Charlotte had a hunch that
chocolate was his favorite treat.
They were walking back from the cafeteria, enjoying the ambiance of the
beautiful surroundings.
Charlotte couldn't help but give John a curious look. She couldn't shake her
observation—his clear love of chocolate.
Am I overthinking this? She wondered.
Today, he went for chocolate ice cream while she settled for a refreshing
strawberry fruit juice. Charlotte realized she might be reading too much into
things since she didn't know John well. But deep down, she felt like she had
guessed correctly. Just look at how he’s enjoying each bite!
"Yeah, chocolate is the best!" John replied, his response brief and sweet,
as he continued enjoying his delicious treat without missing a beat.
"But are you sure ice cream is enough for you? You said you hadn't
eaten anything all day, right?" Charlotte's concerned eyes scanned John's
slender frame.
He appeared healthy enough, but she couldn't help worrying.
"Don't worry about me. I'll grab something after classes. Set number
three of the fruit salad mix looked so tempting, but it's best when it's fresh.

We only have five minutes until class starts." John licked his lips and took
another bite of his ice cream.
"Well, that's true." They were already climbing the stairs to their
classroom on the first floor.
"Thanks for treating me, though. It's so delicious," John said, once again
savoring the chocolate ice cream. Charlotte couldn't help but notice how it
melted on his tongue. She found herself craving the same delightful
experience.
Suddenly, her throat felt dry, and her mouth watered. It was strange because
she was already enjoying her fruit juice. Her gaze shifted to her drink, and it
suddenly felt insufficient. She craved ice cream now. Of course, she would
never let John catch on to her embarrassing realization.
"Haha, no problem—"
"But are you sure that juice is enough for you? I mean, if it's because of
me, then—"
"No! It's fine. Hahaha! I'm good, really," Charlotte blurted out, unable
to hide her embarrassment. It was one thing for her to realize she had made
a mistake by choosing juice, but if John noticed it too, she didn't know how
to handle the situation.
Why am I feeling so embarrassed? Even expressing natural reactions like
this... She had never expected to let go of her anxieties and genuinely enjoy
someone's company.
However, as the dark thought of her stalker returned to her mind, the joy
she was feeling started to fade.
I'm sorry, John. I'm being selfish right now, but I truly am sorry.
Charlotte understood the risks of involving someone else in her problem.
She realized that by changing seats, she could potentially expose another
person to her stalker. Despite Anonymous assuring her many times that he
was only interested in her, how could she be sure of what he might do to an
innocent person?
That creep will definitely be upset about me changing seats. John might get
dragged into this. In the end, I'm just being selfish. It's wrong, and I feel so

guilty. I wish I could tell him everything. I wish I didn't have to lie or hide
the truth from him.
He deserves to know!
Yet...
I'm scared. I... I just can't tell him. I can't say anything, or else...
A week of being stalked had slowly chipped away at Charlotte's selfconfidence, which had taken her a long time to build. What remained was
her best effort to keep herself together.
They were just a few steps away from their classroom, with about three
minutes until the next class began when Charlotte couldn't hold back her
emotions any longer. She felt the need to say something, even if it was just
a small fraction of her true feelings.
"J-John, thank you," Charlotte said, her voice trembling slightly. She
abruptly stopped, her gaze fixed on the ground. She wasn't sure why she
had chosen this moment to express herself, but she couldn't bear to keep it
bottled up any longer.
"You didn't have to give up your seat. You could have ignored it like
everyone else. But you still helped me, without even asking why."
She had noticed his hesitation when the seat-switching issue came up. Like
everyone else, he probably wanted to keep his seat. Yet... he helped me. He’s
different. I misjudged him.
At first, Charlotte had thought John was creepy. But as she reconsidered,
she saw that he might just be a kind-hearted person. Her initial judgment of
John had been flawed, and she realized it now.
After observing him all day, she came to a genuine conclusion: He's a much
better person than I thought. He's better than me.
Everything John said and did showed sincerity without being overly nice.
He wasn't the type to go out of his way to help people, unlike Charlotte.
Despite this, Charlotte had no doubts in her heart about his sincerity.
"You truly are a good person, John," she told him.
His smile turned into a look of surprise as his blue eyes widened in
response to her declaration.

Don't be so surprised, John. I am a good judge of character, and I can tell.
You're genuinely kind. Charlotte extended her hand, offering a warm smile.
It was surreal for her to be taking this step, but she almost couldn't believe it
herself.
I'm doing this, for real this time. A nervous smile crept onto her face, and
her heart raced slightly as she witnessed her hands rise to a balanced
position.
Charlotte steeled her heart and strengthened her resolve. It didn't matter that
this was her first time making a genuine friendship gesture in years or that
John would be her first friend in this school. He had already done more than
enough to earn it.
No, I would be honored if he accepted! Charlotte's offer was wholeheartedly
given, solely based on the goodness of John's character.
His true goodness.
"John, will you be my friend?”

CHAPTER 6
PERSONA
Humans are like an iceberg; what is visible is but a fraction of a person’s true nature.
______________________________________

Both John and Charlotte locked eyes, their emotions intensifying, creating
an uncomfortable silence that froze them like statues.
Then, an unexpected question shattered the stillness, "Will you be my
friend?" But all it received was a profound silence in reply.
John started to stammer, "I, uh..."
But he never got a chance to finish his response.
DING!
The alarm blared, signaling the end of their break.
"I..." John restarted, but he was interrupted by a looming figure.
It was their teacher, Mr. Edward Kieran, a tall, stern man with graying hair
that matched the wrinkles on his face. He taught Religion at Richardson
Elite Academy, and while most students liked the school, Mr. Kieran's strict
demeanor didn't win him any popularity points.
Charlotte didn't have much of an opinion about him, but his stern
expression upon seeing her and John out of class made her understand why
some students didn't like him.
‘S-scary,’ she thought.
Luckily, she knew how to handle people like her teacher. The best thing to
do was retreat.
"Um, sorry. We'll chat later, John," Charlotte quickly excused herself,
giving a small nod of greeting to Mr. Kieran. Meanwhile, John stood still,

staring into the distance with a vacant look in his eyes.
"Young man, break time is over. You should be in class right now," Mr.
Kieran's deep voice boomed as he moved closer to John. But it seemed as
though John paid no attention to the teacher's intimidating tone.
Perhaps he didn't hear it.
"Right, I should be in class now, shouldn't I?" John replied, still
blatantly ignoring Mr. Kieran. He walked back towards the classroom,
disappearing from the bewildered teacher's sight. Now, it was Mr. Kieran's
turn to freeze, standing motionless in the hallway.
That kid... who is he? Mr. Kieran wondered to himself.
______________________________________

What am I doing?
Charlotte was supposed to be paying attention in class, but her mind kept
wandering, making it hard to grasp the topic being taught.
Her gaze was fixed on the teacher, and she looked like she was fully
focused on the lesson. She even managed to jot down a few notes on her
tablet. Yet, deep down, her thoughts kept going back to what had just
happened with John.
Why can’t I stop thinking about it?
Asking someone to be her friend had never been a problem for Charlotte,
although those requests had mostly been online. What made this situation
different was that she had asked in person, and the lack of a clear response
left her feeling uneasy.
Most of Charlotte's social interactions happened online. She was skilled at
building relationships through social media, but she also enjoyed talking to
people face-to-face. It had been a while, though, since she'd asked someone
to be her friend in person.
It held more meaning for her than words could express, and the absence of a
response only increased her anxiety. Why did I expect so much? Was I too
direct? Or too impatient?

Lost in her thoughts, Charlotte couldn't help but wonder why John had
hesitated.
Is there something bothering him? Maybe he's just shy. He did seem kinda
surprised, after all…
Maybe she was just overthinking things.
John must have been caught off guard since someone like her was asking
for his friendship.
She wasn't a narcissist, but her usual interactions had others reaching out to
her, not the other way around.
Charlotte's gaze shifted left, landing on John's face, seemingly focused on
the teacher. At first glance, he seemed attentive, just like Charlotte.
However, she knew better than to judge solely based on appearances.
After all, who would guess that her thoughts were preoccupied with a boy?
John lightly tapped his fingers on his desk, a clear sign of restlessness.
Charlotte, ever observant, noticed his distracted behavior and realized he
wasn't fully engaged in the class.
Was he, perhaps, thinking about the question she had asked earlier?
John seems like a loner. Maybe he was surprised by the suddenness of it all.
The more Charlotte thought about it, the more she convinced herself not to
overanalyze the situation. John's reaction was probably just a natural
response.
Having put the question out there, Charlotte decided it was best to let things
take their course. Sooner or later, John's decision about her request would
become clear.
It was just a matter of time.
‘I hope he says yes, though. He seems like he'd be a great friend,’ Charlotte
thought with hope. With this positive outlook, she found a sense of closure
and regained the motivation to fully focus on the intriguing topic of various
aspects of Religion.
______________________________________

The school day ended, and as students said their goodbyes or headed home
in groups, Charlotte found herself walking alongside John.
It was 3:01 PM, just a minute after their classes had ended, and their
descent down the stairs was filled with an awkward silence. If they hadn't
made this arrangement earlier, Charlotte wondered if she would have
chosen to walk with him.
‘This silence is weird. I should liven things up,’ Charlotte thought, her
social instincts kicking in as ideas flowed into her mind. She had plenty of
options to choose from.
"So, how are you finding the classes so far? Any subjects or teachers
you particularly like?" Charlotte's friendly and comforting voice broke the
silence. She hoped her question would keep the conversation going, and
thankfully, it did.
"They've been great. I really like this school's approach. It's unique,
very different," John replied, expressing his enthusiasm. Surprisingly, he
revealed that his favorite subject was Religion.
"Wow, I didn't expect you to be so interested, especially with our...
unique teacher," Charlotte chuckled.
"Well, our school approaches religion differently. It's not just about
deification or set beliefs. Except for Family, it's one of the most subjective
courses," John explained.
"Yeah, I noticed. I thought we'd talk more about theism or deism,"
Charlotte replied quickly. John nodded, showing his excitement as if he was
impressed by her contribution to the conversation.
"At our school, Religion is linked with Philosophy, social constructs,
and morality. We explore various theories and engage in discussions that
challenge or strengthen our beliefs. It's fascinating, right? What's even more
intriguing is that the school doesn't tell us what to think but teaches us how
to critically examine what we're taught. That's what education is all about,"
John passionately shared his views, leaving Charlotte captivated by his
genuine enthusiasm. It was clear that he had a deep passion for the subject.
Something about the way John spoke made him seem more than just a
typical high school student. Charlotte had met mature individuals before

and had developed a preference for certain types of conversations. Her brief
exchange with John reminded her of those engaging interactions.
"But isn't religion inherently dogmatic? Doesn't it encourage devotion
to a specific belief?" Charlotte was now intrigued by John's perspective and
decided to share her own.
"You're right. Religion often centers around a central figure like God or
gods. However, in an educational setting, it's essential to be objective. By
approaching the study of religion from an educational perspective, we can
explore ideas and reach valid conclusions," John explained. He elaborated
on how various philosophical positions and arguments were crucial for a
broader understanding of theology and religion. He also emphasized the
importance of jurisprudence, morality, and other aspects of social control.
He went on and on.
"You seem quite knowledgeable on the subject, even though you've only
had a few classes, John," Charlotte said, giving him a slightly suspicious
smile. He chuckled and scratched his head, as if searching for the right
words.
"Well, I watch a lot of online videos in my free time. I do a bit of reading
too. Hahaha."
"Really? Just a bit?" She smiled playfully, narrowing her gaze.
"For real. Although I prefer listening," John shrugged. "How about you,
Charlotte?"
"I love reading," Charlotte declared.
As she thought for a moment, a question came to mind.
"Hey, John, which school did you go to before coming here?"
"Oh, I was homeschooled. I used to live alone with my dad until my
grandfather brought me to the city a few months ago. What about you?"
John replied.
"Wow, that's pretty similar! I was homeschooled too," Charlotte
exclaimed, her eyes widening in surprise.
"No way!" John looked genuinely surprised. "But you're so great at
interacting with others! It's hard to believe."

Charlotte chuckled in response.
"Believe it or not, I was. Although, I did a lot of volunteer work and
community service before coming here. I guess that's why I try to get along
with people around me."
"Ah, that's different from me. I've always been kind of a shut-in," John
confessed, letting out a slight laugh.
"My grandfather has been trying to get me to go out more often,
though. Honestly, being here and seeing the city is so exciting. There are so
many places to explore. Everything feels so different."
Charlotte laughed heartily as John expressed his admiration for the Island.
It was remarkable how everyone spoke so highly of this place, considering
it was an artificial island that had been constructed just two decades ago.
"Honestly, I love traveling. It's an amazing experience that leaves a
lasting impression. You should give it a try sometime, John," Charlotte
suggested, playfully nudging him. "If you're not sure where to begin, I can
show you around Australia. The city I grew up in has tons of cool stuff to
see."
"Really? You'd do that?" John asked, surprised.
"Of course. Well, you'd have to check with your grandfather first. I
wouldn't want to whisk his precious grandson away," Charlotte teased,
enjoying the flustered expression on John's face.
"I don't think Grandfather would mind... I hope," John replied, his voice
trailing off.
Just then, they arrived at their destination—the garden outside the Central
Building. Although Charlotte wanted to continue their conversation, she
decided to put it on hold for now.
Something more important was at hand.
It was finally time for John to keep his promise and show her the security
camera.
True to the reputation of a prestigious school, the garden was a vibrant
paradise, brimming with the wonders of nature. Multicolored flowers

blossomed, filling the air with their delightful scent. The grass beneath their
feet was soft and inviting.
Though relatively small, the garden exuded abundant beauty.
"Look, aren't those the purple hibiscuses you mentioned earlier?"
Charlotte pointed to a group of striking flowers with distinct violet hues.
"They remind me of your eyes," John said, standing beside her.
"You read my mind," Charlotte replied, a gentle smile on her face.
Despite her initial indifference toward flowers, she understood why John
found them so charming.
"It's a shame they don't have the blue hibiscus. It's even rarer than the
purple one," John said, his gaze shifting to another part of the garden.
"The camera is over there. It's not very noticeable, but if you look
closely..."
Charlotte followed John's direction and quickly understood what he meant.
The camera was discreetly placed, blending seamlessly into the black and
white walls of the school, amidst the vibrant colors of the garden's flowers.
It's impressive how you found it so easily. Charlotte thought to herself,
impressed by John's keen eye.
"Because of the camera, I couldn't take the purple hibiscus home," John
confessed, offering a weak smile. Charlotte couldn't help but feel a pang of
sympathy for him. It was clear he truly cherished those flowers.
"But who says it's strictly against the rules?" A mischievous grin spread
across Charlotte's face as an idea struck her. Mr. Archibald had gone over
the Academy's regulations, and plucking a flower wasn't explicitly
prohibited. However, damaging school property was definitely discouraged,
leaving the legality of the act uncertain.
"We can't be sure it's not against the rules either," John sighed. "Are we
done here? We should prepare for whatever test we have tomorrow."
Charlotte sensed a hint of disappointment in his tone. Although John hadn't
addressed the topic of friendship she had brought up earlier, she couldn't
help but see him in that light.

"It's just a stem, right? There are plenty here, and one won't be missed,"
Charlotte suggested, trying to ease John's worries.
"But that's not the point. It's about the act itself, and..." John seemed a bit
flustered, appearing even more harmless than usual.
"How about this? I'll block the camera's view, and you can quickly grab
the flower," Charlotte proposed with a carefree tone, giving John a
conspiratorial wink.
"Charlotte, you... I didn't know you were a rule breaker," John responded,
causing her to blush slightly in embarrassment.
All she wanted was to help a friend, and she genuinely didn't think taking
one flower would be a big deal. If it could boost his confidence, Charlotte
believed it was worth being an accomplice.
It's not like I'm a rebel or anything! she nearly blurted out, trying to clarify
the misunderstanding.
"I have to admit, this is kind of cool," John chuckled, cutting off any
excuses she might have made. Seeing his smile, Charlotte couldn't help but
smile too.
What a sweet and surprisingly clever boy she had met.
"Maybe I should be the one to pluck the hibiscus. You can cover for
me," she suggested.
"N-no, it's fine. I'll do it. I don't want you to get in trouble because of
me. Besides, you're taller," John insisted, preventing Charlotte from being
the one to pick the flower. She felt as though he doubted her ability, given
the delicacy of the task, but she was probably overthinking things.
"Okay, Charlotte... I'll do it now," he trembled, reaching out for the
purple plant.
Charlotte did her best to appear nonchalant while keeping an eye on his
position. Her heart raced with a mixture of excitement and fear. Who would
have thought she'd be breaking the school rules on her first week?
‘I’m not even sure if it's actually against the rules or not,’ she thought,
trying to reassure herself. With that comforting reminder in mind, Charlotte
mustered the strength to go along with the situation. This was simply a

favor she was repaying for John's help so far. Even if she couldn't reveal the
truth, her heart resonated with his.
I owe you that much, John. Really.

______________________________________

"I guess this is it," John said with a slight bow and a smile. The sparkle
in his bright blue eyes revealed that he had truly enjoyed their time together,
bringing a sense of relief to Charlotte.
Despite their initial awkwardness, things had turned out well as they delved
into various topics during their conversation. But now, they found
themselves standing at a crossroads that would separate them. Although
they both seemed eager to continue talking, their paths diverged toward
different destinations.
I'm heading back to my dorm, while John walks home. Charlotte thought,
wondering why he chose to live off campus. Perhaps it has something to do
with his grandfather.
The thought sparked her curiosity, but she decided to leave it for another
day. At that moment, Charlotte realized she had more pressing matters to
attend to.
"Alright then, see you tomorrow," she forced a strained smile, but as the
words left her lips, life drained from her face. Despite her skill at hiding her
emotions, it proved immensely difficult this time. Tremors ran through her
body, and her voice quivered as she bid farewell to her companion.
Within seconds, John would leave, leaving Charlotte to walk back to her
dorm alone. The thought gnawed at her, evoking a mix of fear and
vulnerability.
No. I hate feeling like this. Charlotte muttered to herself.
Fear and a sense of impending danger gripped Charlotte, overshadowing the
joy she had felt all day with John. His presence had consumed her thoughts,
and the moments they shared radiated positivity. Charlotte hadn't noticed
the approaching loneliness until it was too late.
She would soon be left alone to face it all again.
T-this, I can't bear it. The thought of walking alone, vulnerable to a
potential stalker in the shadows, was too much for Charlotte. It caused her
stomach to churn with pain, an indescribable agony.
W-what if he... what if the stalker...?! Did she provoke them by swapping
seats with John and reporting the incident? Charlotte couldn't even begin to

imagine the horrors that might befall her. The horrifying possibilities sent
her into a state of hyperventilation.
Her throat went dry, and she shivered. What had started as a mild chill now
left goosebumps on her skin. Overwhelming fear took hold, causing her
heart to race uncontrollably. Charlotte felt utterly overwhelmed and
sickened.
N-no...
Her head spun, and an inescapable dread closed in on her.
‘I can't do this!’ she thought, trembling.
The weight of the dark reality bearing down on her grew heavier with each
passing moment.
‘Please!’ She begged silently.
At this rate, the terror would consume her, driving her slowly toward
insanity. Could she even take a single step forward? Doubt swirled in her
heart as she closed her eyes, engulfed in fear.
"Want me to walk you to your dorm?" A familiar voice broke through
her meltdown.
"H-huh...?" Charlotte's eyes, moist with tears, widened in relief rather
than surprise as she saw John standing right beside her.
"I really enjoyed our conversation. It would be a shame if it ended so
soon. Besides, it wouldn't hurt to see what the dorms look like."
Charlotte was at a loss for words.
"W-what do you say? I mean, if you're okay with it."
There were so many things she could say.
Charlotte felt acutely aware of the trouble she might impose on John. It
would be better for him not to get further entangled in her problems.
Dragging him deeper into her mess wouldn't just be selfish but could also
put him at risk.
‘I should decline politely,’ she thought, ‘I can handle this on my own.’ Her
thoughts wavered for a moment, but she found her resolve.

Despite her appreciation for John's kind gesture, Charlotte couldn't, in good
conscience, let him go to such lengths for her. He was a genuinely good
person, and she couldn't bear to exploit his kindness for her own needs. She
knew all of that.
Yet...
"Of course, John. I also think we should continue," Charlotte said with
a smile as she gracefully wiped away her tears with her uniform. "Some
dust got into my eyes," she offered as a quick explanation for her sudden
display of emotions.
"Don't tell me you were crying. Were you that into our conversation?
Wow, I... I don't know what to say, like..."
John's oblivious yet charming response brought a soft chuckle from
Charlotte. Gradually, her fear vanished like magic, and she felt more herself
again in just a few seconds.
"Don't make a big deal out of it. It's just dust." Charlotte began walking
toward her dorm, and John had to quicken his pace to keep up with her.
"Haha! But you know what? Your quick retreat kinda supports my
theory," John joked playfully.
Charlotte smiled lightly, deciding to change the subject.
"Hey, shouldn't you worry more about your flower?" she asked.
John held the purple hibiscus they had swiped gently, she knew he needed
to put it in water or graft it quickly to keep it from wilting. At least, that was
what Charlotte knew about flowers.
"Yeah, you're right. But don't worry. Flowers usually last about an hour
without water before they start to droop. Temperature plays a role too, and
since it's cooler here, it should hold up longer," John explained, seemingly
prepared for her question.
"Is that so?" Charlotte asked, raising an eyebrow. John's smug
expression made her second-guess her decision to talk about the flower in
the first place.
"Absolutely! Just to be safe, I'll grab a flower pot or a jar of water on
my way home. Little Violet will be just fine," John assured her with a gentle

smile, tenderly caressing the flower. It still appeared fresh, which was no
surprise, considering they had picked it just a moment ago.
"You've already named it? How sweet," Charlotte commented.
"H-hey, you're not making fun of me, are you?" John pretended to pout,
but it only made him seem even more cute.
"Maybe..." Charlotte teased.
"I knew it!" John exclaimed, and before she knew it, Charlotte found
herself giggling uncontrollably.
Her laughter was genuine and wholehearted.
"You're so mean," John said, his pout strangely adorable, making
Charlotte burst out laughing.
"Haha, you're hilarious, John," Charlotte replied.
She was surprised. She hadn't laughed so freely since her encounter with the
stalker. Every chat with John had a way of making her genuinely happy. It
wasn't because he did something incredibly funny; it just felt natural.
It felt like she could forget all her troubles by looking into his innocent eyes
and listening to his childlike yet wise words.
"Hey, I'm serious. I really am," John insisted, his cheeks turning a little
pink as he brooded.
"Stop it," Charlotte protested, her laughter mixed with giggles. She
tried to be quiet, but her laughter only increased as she watched John's
comical expression.
Yeah, this is so much fun. If only things could stay like this, she could end
her day without any regrets.
"Hey there, you two are from Year 1B, right? Having fun?" a voice
interrupted Charlotte and John.
The voice came from behind them, and it sounded a bit prickly. Charlotte
stifled her laughter, and John stopped making funny faces. They were both
surprised yet curious about the stranger.
"Good evening. Who are you?" John asked cautiously, a question
Charlotte would have asked herself.

"Ah, my mistake." The newcomer smiled and gave a polite nod. She
curtsied gracefully, almost like royalty.
She was about John's height, with short peach-colored hair that contrasted
with Charlotte's. Her bright almond eyes seemed elegant, even with that
cold smile. Her face seemed harmless, but her gaze felt calculative and
piercing.
"I'm Mary Anne, but you can call me Mary. I'm in Class A, same year as
you," she said.

Charlotte's chest tightened, realizing this was her first conversation with
someone from the other class. She had intended to chat with a Class A
member earlier but had become too preoccupied with her own issues.
John, ever quick to respond, said, "I'm John, and this is Charlotte. Nice to
meet you too."
Charlotte wondered about Mary's motive for approaching them. Why is a
member of Class A showing up now? Could she be the stalker? There’s no
way, right?
She had already ruled out students as the stalker. Mary didn't fit the profile
– not that you could tell a stalker by looks alone.
"I saw the two of you laughing on my way back from the library, "
Mary remarked, her fingers delicately tracing invisible patterns on her skirt.
"Many first-years wouldn't be in the mood, considering what's happening
tomorrow."
"You mean the special class?" Charlotte asked, her gaze narrowing.
"No, I mean the class exercise." Mary clarified.
Mary’s forward tone and knowing smile instantly cut through Charlotte’s
weak and ineffective attempt to conceal her lack of knowledge of the true
nature of their weekend class.
John chimed in, “Are you sure you should be revealing this info to your
competition?”
Exactly what I was thinking! Charlotte thought to herself, wondering why
Mary was being so open about it. Wouldn't it be better to keep such
information to herself, giving her class an advantage?
The less people knew of it, the better.
Despite John's question and Charlotte's suspicion, Mary appeared unfazed.
"Oh, please, it's quite obvious by now. Your class must have figured it
out too." Mary's voice carried an air of superiority that intimidated
Charlotte, even more than Mia's antics. But Charlotte took a deep breath
and composed herself.
She wasn't going to back down easily.

"Really? I guess you have a point," Charlotte said, deciding to play it
cool.
Even though her entire class wasn't aware of any special exercise, Mary
seemed to think otherwise and she wanted to keep it that way.
‘I would've brought it up in class, but I had other things on my mind, like
John and my other issues,’ she thought.
Still, from the way Mary spoke so confidently about the exercise, and how
she so easily dismissed it to be general knowledge, it seemed Year 1A was
already ahead of them.
That made Charlotte incredibly nervous.
Our class really needs to step up its game. She thought nervously.
"Well, tomorrow will definitely be interesting. I guess I'll see you two
around." With another courteous bow, Mary ended the conversation and
walked past them.
Charlotte didn't know what to say, her thoughts were all jumbled. John's
silence mirrored her uncertainty. Rather than risking giving away
information to the enemy, it seemed wiser to silently watch the girl as she
walked away.
A short while passed in silence. Both John and Charlotte remained quiet,
lost in thought.
Finally, John spoke, breaking the silence. "What's your take on this,
Charlotte?"
She answered in a low voice, although there was no need to.
"I think we need to step up if we want to compete with Year 1A. The
way things are now, we're not on an equal footing."
Charlotte was also curious about John's thoughts. "What about you, John?
What do you make of that girl?"
"I honestly don't know," John replied, sounding a bit puzzled, which
was unusual for him. "It's too soon to judge. But I think your observations
are right. We'll get a clearer picture of things tomorrow."

"Yeah, you've got a point there," Charlotte said, letting go of the tense
topic and flashing a smile. They were having such a great time before Mary
butted in, and Charlotte hoped they could continue enjoying themselves
with the little time they had left.
"Let's just hope Violet doesn't catch a cold on the way back home,"
Charlotte added, noticing how John had his arm wrapped around his
beloved flower. She decided to switch gears and inject some humor back
into their conversation.
True to form, John reacted right away. "H-hey!"
______________________________________

Charlotte's heart always skipped a beat whenever she hung out with John.
Getting along with her peers wasn't a cakewalk, not because she was
antisocial—far from it!—but because her mindset was different. She had
seen the world, been part of all sorts of communities, and just couldn't get
excited about shallow topics like boys, fashion, or gossip. She hungered for
deep talks, but finding friends who felt the same was like finding a needle
in a haystack.
Sadly, every time she tried to steer the conversation in a more meaningful
direction with a group of teens, they'd often give her strange looks.
Actually, most of them would just label her as weird or call her a prude.
Thanks to this groupthink thing that a lot of teenage cliques had going on,
making real friends was no piece of cake for her.
The boys get attracted to me, and the girls get jealous. Everyone wants to
talk about topics with no staying power. What about the things that really
matter?
Why are most teenagers so obsessed with the ordinary? It made Charlotte
feel uneasy.
But then, there was John. He was unlike anyone else, in the best way
possible. When they talked, she couldn't help but learn from him. He
listened attentively, holding onto every word she said and even recalling
things from her previous comments when he spoke. It was truly captivating!

Their conversations were so interesting that time passed quickly. What
should have been a short fifteen-minute walk to the girls' dorms turned into
over thirty minutes, and Charlotte didn't mind at all.
However, as they say, all good things must come to an end, and so did their
conversation.
It's a shame that it's ending soon.
Though Charlotte wanted to bring up the topic of friendship once more,
they had already reached the entrance of Charlotte's dorm, the Richardson
Elite Academy's residence for high school girls.
"Wow, it's huge," John murmured, almost under his breath.
The female dormitory was truly impressive, with two huge buildings facing
each other, all covered in shiny marble tiles. The place had a lovely garden
that added to its charm. It seemed like the perfect place to relax after a long
day.
Security cameras were scattered around, reminding the students that they
had limits to their freedom. Nonetheless, even the entrance was quite
impressive.
Charlotte hesitated for a moment, wishing she could show John more of the
dorm. However, she knew it wouldn't be possible. The place had automated
systems that required either Student IDs or facial recognition, so only
female students could enter.
Charlotte figured that John might not be allowed inside.
"We do have a dorm supervisor, though. She doesn't visit often, but no
one knows when she might show up," Charlotte remarked, noticing John's
intrigued expression. Maybe this information would make him reconsider
staying at the school dorm.
During their earlier walk, Charlotte had asked John why he chose to live
off-campus. His answer was heartwarming; he loved being with his
grandfather, and Charlotte admired his honesty. John was typical in that
way, he never avoided questions and always kept it real. That's one of the
things I like about him.

As they made their way to the dorms, they talked about many things. From
their conversation, Charlotte had learned a lot about John's character, and it
matched her expectations—it was very pleasant.
"I thought everything we saw on our way here was great, but this is
amazing too."
When they were walking towards the dorms, they had passed by several
other buildings, including a mall, a store, a café, and a cool leisure center.
John also asked Charlotte if she had gotten a chance to explore these places,
and she shook her head.
"That’s why many students were excited about the weekend," she
added. When Charlotte put it that way, it made sense why students didn't
like the idea of weekend classes.
While most students grumbled about weekend classes, Charlotte didn't
mind them. She was too curious about all the exciting things waiting for her
there. The only downside was having less time for her dissertation. ‘I guess
I'll have to put in some extra hours tonight,’ she had thought during their
conversation.
Regardless, John and Charlotte had a great time together. It felt a bit
awkward knowing they would meet again the next day, but it was
something to look forward to. Even though John hadn't accepted Charlotte's
offer of friendship just yet, she felt like they had grown closer.
Maybe I should ask him again? she wondered.
"So, John—" Charlotte started.
"Charlotte, I—"
Both teenagers started talking at the same time, and they paused in surprise.
There was a moment of silence, and they shared an awkward smile.
After a brief quiet moment, Charlotte gathered her courage and took a step
forward, ready to express her feelings. John deserved to know how she felt.
"I had a great time today, John. Even though it was short, I felt like I
learned more in these past few minutes than hours of talking with most
people, a-and—"

Why did her words suddenly get stuck in her throat? It wasn't her first time
in a situation like this, but something held her back, making her heart race.
"There's something I need to tell you, Charlotte," John interrupted
before she could find the strength to continue.
"Huh?" Surprise crossed her face as she noticed the serious tone in his
voice. He appeared hesitant, fidgeting a bit, but determination shone in his
expression.
"About your offer of friendship, there's a reason I didn't answer right
away."
Caught off-guard, Charlotte's mind raced.
What was John going to say? She hadn't expected him to just blurt it out
like this, but she had a sense that he was wrestling with something.
I knew it! Could it be that he was considering my offer? The thought
made her heart race. Curiosity and anxiety mixed within her as she waited
for him to continue. Let's hear what he has to say.
She was ready to accept whatever he had to say and defend her case if
needed.
"The truth is… I'm the one you're looking for. The person with the
perfect score in class, it's me," John finally revealed.
Charlotte's eyes widened in amazement. This revelation was not what she
had expected. She had thought she might hear the usual excuses like
"You're too popular and pretty for me" or "I don't think we'd be a good fit."
But this?
John is the one who got the perfect score? I can't believe it. She couldn't
wrap her head around it. Was I completely wrong about him?
As her thoughts whirled around, an expression of surprise and disbelief
slipped from her lips without her realizing it.
"I-I’m not the name faker, though. I never lied about my name. I'm
still John Lenard, and my ID is legit. Remember, I showed you in class and
Mr. Matthias' office," John explained, hoping to clear up any confusion.

Memories of those moments came rushing back to Charlotte. John had been
genuinely helpful when she was trying to figure out how to use the school's
tablets and IDs during the seat exchange. He wasn't the deceiver she had
been searching for, and she felt a pang of guilt for doubting him even for a
moment.
"John, I'm sorry. For a moment there, I actually thought you were the
one behind the fake name thing,” she admitted, her voice tinged with regret.
"N-no, it's okay. I understand how it sounded, and I'd probably have
thought the same," John replied, sounding a bit flustered.
Charlotte couldn't help but notice how gracious he was about the whole
situation. She realized she needed to be less quick to jump to conclusions
and give him the benefit of the doubt.
I know this is because of my past experiences, but I need to do better.
Still, something about John's story seemed incomplete. With a hint of
skepticism, she probed,
"But if you got a perfect score, that means you
must know the true name of the person with the fake name!"
Her words took her by surprise, and she quickly covered her mouth, hoping
no one else had heard. But she knew it was too late to take them back.
"Yeah. I do. I've known all along. I thought it was odd that he lied
about his name, but I didn't think it was a big deal, so I kept it to myself. I'm
sorry," John confessed, his downcast expression revealing his sincere regret
for keeping this secret.
Charlotte understood that she couldn't keep pushing John for answers.
"N-no, it's fine. You didn't know why he lied, and you probably
wanted to respect his privacy, right?"
"Y-yeah, exactly!" John affirmed, his words coming out a bit fast.
"But what I don't get is why you didn't tell me, or say something in
class when we were trying to find the person with the fake name. You
could've at least talked to me. Or do you not trust m—"
"No! It's not that!" John's response was surprisingly loud, and he
quickly apologized for his outburst. Charlotte found it endearing, despite
her initial surprise.

He spoke without thinking. It must be the truth. Spontaneous reactions were
often truthful, revealing one's true intentions.
"I wanted to understand why he was doing it. I've been watching not just
him but some of our classmates, trying to figure out the truth," John
explained, his voice slightly uncertain.
"I still don't know why he's hiding his name, though..." he added,
expressing his confusion.
"So, shouldn't we expose him or talk to him about it? That way, we'll
finally get the answers we need," Charlotte suggested.
"Yeah, you're probably right, though I'm not entirely sure," John
admitted.
Charlotte's curiosity got the best of her, and she leaned in, studying John's
uncertain face. "Do you have some kind of history with him? You seem
reluctant to expose him."
"Not exactly. I know him, though he might not recognize me. It's just…
I have a philosophy, you see." John wore a warm smile and looked straight
into Charlotte's eyes.
She paused and asked, "What's your philosophy?"
A small smile crept onto John's face, and he seemed pleased by her interest.
"It's simple: Before concluding, fully comprehend the subject matter."
His words, spoken softly, held deep meaning. Charlotte took a moment to
absorb them. "... Comprehend the subject matter?"
"Exactly. I don't want to jump to conclusions or rush my assessment.
Things are often more complicated than they seem. Our actions might
unintentionally harm the situation," John explained.
I see his point. It could drive the class further apart. Besides, I’m not in a
great situation in the class right now. If we push it any further...
"You mentioned it yourself. Year 1A is one step ahead of us, maybe
more. We need to know what we’re dealing with first. If we rush into things
and it affects how we work together as a class, it will only benefit our
opposition."

In conclusion, John's plan was to find the most effective and least damaging
option. Charlotte found herself intrigued by his mindset.
"Do you have any ideas?" she asked, breaking the uncomfortable
silence between them.
"Not yet. Hopefully, tomorrow will reveal some clues. I need to
observe the situation more before deciding," John replied, his hand on his
chin.
After taking several deep breaths, Charlotte let out a tired sigh. As much as
she initially disagreed with John’s approach and his decision not to tell her,
she now understood why he made such a move—or rather, why he didn’t
make any moves at all.
“I think I understand why you did what you did, John. Really,” she
said, her voice softer now, wanting to reassure him that she wasn't upset.
"So, yeah," he continued. "I felt guilty about keeping all that from you,
despite knowing how much it meant to you. That’s why I couldn’t answer
back then.”
Charlotte listened attentively, realizing the burden he must have carried.
"I understand why you did what you did, John. Really.”
But… Why did you finally decide to talk? Charlotte wondered silently.
“S-so, I wanted to get this off my chest, at the very least. I don’t like
keeping secrets from my friends,” John mumbled.
He gave a shy smile, and for a moment, their gazes locked. Charlotte’s eyes
widened as she noticed all of this.
Could it be? Had he finally opened up because he considered her a friend?
But just this wasn’t enough. She wanted certainty.
"I'd love to be your friend, Charlotte," John said, extending his hand
with hopeful eyes.
Her heart skipped a beat. It was happening. He considered her a friend.
After watching John in silence for a while, Charlotte noticed him frown
slightly.

“Do you…not want to anymore?” He gently tilted his head to the side.
Something in the glimmer of his eyes made him seem like he might cry, but
it was probably just her imagination.
"Of course, I'd love to be your friend too," she replied, her excitement
bubbling over. "I just wish you'd told me sooner. You made me worried for
nothing. Haha!"
With a flustered declaration, Charlotte shook his hand, feeling the warmth
spread through her. Her focus was less on his grip and more on his face.
They locked eyes, with John's head slightly raised and Charlotte's slightly
inclined downward. Regardless of their height or gender differences, these
two understood each other.

They had a connection.

Under the enchanting evening sun, they became friends.
‘Thank you, John. I... I've finally made my first friend here,’ Charlotte
whispered in her thoughts, her heart brimming with joy and gratitude.
______________________________________

The two friends said their goodbyes, looking forward to talking more the
next day. They had exchanged email addresses, and Charlotte even gave
John her phone number.
"I don't have a phone. My grandfather is a bit old-fashioned," John
explained when the topic came up, but Charlotte still gave him her number.
How could she call him a friend if he didn't have that much?
As Charlotte entered her dorm with a smile on her face and a warm feeling
in her heart, they waved goodbye several times before finally parting ways.
Hehe... I find the whole thing funny, surreal even. When was the last time I
had a physical friend? Has it been since elementary school? Charlotte
thought, reminiscing.
Ah, yes, right before the incident. Charlotte remembered the darkest period
in her life like it was yesterday. It was this exact piece of information that
her stalker threatened to expose if she didn't cooperate.
"No way am I thinking about that after such a good day!" Charlotte
resolved, muttering as she climbed the stairs to her room.
She stayed in Block B on the fourth floor, and while she could take an
elevator, Charlotte preferred to take the stairs. It was a good way to stay fit
and maybe shed some of the extra weight she had gained recently.
Did John notice? Charlotte wondered. He was strangely observant. Maybe
he noticed her slightly plumper appearance? Ugh, why am I even thinking
about this? I'm just a pound or two heavier than usual. Some people have it
worse, you know? I have to stop this negative thinking.
Unfortunately, Charlotte had to give an internal sigh as she noticed
someone descending the stairs as she ascended. It seemed she couldn't
avoid this encounter.

The student in view was Mia Elena, wearing her usual smug smile.
Honestly, Charlotte would have preferred to ignore her, but she didn't want
to give Mia any reason to speak ill of her - not that it wasn't happening
already. At least this way, anything Mia says won’t matter.
"Hey, Mia. Heading out?" Charlotte greeted with a smile and a wave.
Mia was dressed casually, in a black sweater and rather short blue shorts.
Charlotte thought the shorts were a tad too revealing, but she didn't say
anything—no, it wasn't her place.
"Oh, it's you, Charlotte. Still in your school uniform? Just returning to
the dorm?" Mia responded, her tone condescending, her fake smile not
fooling anyone.
"Haha, yeah," Charlotte laughed awkwardly, not buying into Mia's false
concern.
"It's getting late, though. Did a boy keep you?" Mia smirked, clearly
enjoying herself.
First of all, I don't have to answer that. She needs to mind her business.
Nosy much? Charlotte felt like Mia was crossing a line but kept her true
thoughts to herself. It was always frustrating when Mia was involved.
"Well, yes. A friend walked me here. What about your friends, Mia?"
Charlotte decided to play it cool, but she thought she heard Mia click her
tongue. She probably imagined it!
"Oh, is it that weirdo who swapped seats with you? What was his name
agai—?"
"John isn't weird!" Charlotte snapped, unable to control herself, and her
true thoughts slipped out. Damn, I messed up.
"Jeez, I was just joking. You didn't have to take it personally," Mia
reacted with a touch of disgust, but Charlotte saw through it. Mia was
probably secretly thrilled to see her break character.
Charlotte had certainly lost some points with her outburst, and Mia was
likely to take advantage of it. Well, whatever. I don't even care. Friends
support each other. She found comfort in knowing that John would have
done the same for her.

That satisfaction alone made it all worthwhile.
"Then, if you'll excuse me," Charlotte continued her ascent, completely
ignoring Mia at that point. She was tired after her day at school - though in
a somewhat good way. Her time with John had been enjoyable, after all.
But I'm hungry, and I could use a snack right now. Ignoring the now audible
tongue-click from beneath the stairs, Charlotte made her way to her room.
First, I'll take a nice shower and freshen up, then I'll get something to eat. I
wonder what I should have for dinner. I wonder if John is hungry too...
An image flashed in her mind, and a smile crept onto her face.
"He'll probably be busy with the hibiscus by now," her grin widened as
she pictured the young boy tenderly holding the delicate plant.
Violet, huh? Such a sweet name.
______________________________________

"It's really pretty, isn't it?" John whispered to himself as he walked
alone.
The cool evening breeze brushed his face, carrying a soothing hum that
enveloped Richardson Elite Academy. The campus was bathed in the warm,
golden glow of the setting sun, and the scent of blooming flowers filled the
air, making the place feel almost magical, like it was straight out of a fairy
tale.
"When did it get so late? I guess we lost track of time..."
Charlotte apologized when she realized how much time they had spent
together. It was when she took out her phone to exchange numbers with him
that she noticed the time. Perhaps if she hadn't brought out her phone, they
could have talked for longer.
"That would have been nice..." He sighed as he cradled the purple
hibiscus close to his stomach, protecting it like a fragile treasure.
It felt like such a missed opportunity.
Time seemed to have betrayed them, cutting their conversation short. Why
did Charlotte have to check her phone? Why did she notice it was nearly

5:00 PM?
I already knew what time it was. I was counting the seconds since we left
the classroom.
Besides, by simply evaluating the position of the sun, the natural climate
and weather conditions, as well as the position of the shadows around,
wasn’t it easy to estimate what the time was?
Of course, he was aware of how long they had spent together.
Oh well, it doesn’t really matter. John’s thoughts trailed as he continued his
solitary walk. He took in the lovely environment, making sure to admire the
beauty of this new part of the campus he had just discovered. The
conversation was productive. I got what I wanted.
John didn't come across any students as he left the campus grounds. Even
when he walked past his classroom building, he saw no one his age around.
Hm? Some people are in the garden? I see… John noticed school staff busy
pruning the garden just outside the general classroom building—the same
garden he and Charlotte had recently explored.
There were about three of them, which seemed excessive for basic pruning
duties, considering the garden was already in excellent condition.
What could they be up to exactly?
Did they catch wind of John and Charlotte's activities? Had the security
camera captured their actions? Was there a second security camera? If they
were caught by the authorities, and now this many staff members were
working in the garden, it would mean trouble for him and Charlotte.
If that were the case, then John’s expression had to be one of fear and
shock.
Anxiety had to be mounting within him as he wondered what to do? He
could try to contact Charlotte, but without a device, he was basically
stranded.
This was bad. Really bad.
Or was it?

They seem to be looking for something. That curious gaze on their faces
and their eyes keep darting all over the place. Yeah. They’re definitely
searching for something. John observed, critically assessing the expressions
of the men. They wore the uniforms of gardeners, but something about the
way they flippantly held their tools seemed off. Also, they sure are taking
their time for a garden that’s already pruned.
John kept his smile intact as he casually walked past the workers. He
adopted a nonchalant expression and continued at his current pace.
What did he have to do with them, and what bothered him about their
presence?
Nothing at all.
He was just a regular student who happened to spend a little extra time on
school grounds.
That was about it.
______________________________________

The moment John left the school grounds, he found himself on an
unfamiliar path, different from his usual route to school.
The streets were crowded, even more so than he was used to, given the late
evening hour. Evening breaks and closing work hours typically began at
5:00 PM, leading to inevitable traffic.
"I should take care of this already?" John whispered, referring to his
little Violet, as he scanned the area to spot the place where he could find
what he needed. His regular route lacked many stores, which led him to
take this detour. The new path felt a bit uncomfortable, but John trusted his
sense of direction; he was confident he wouldn't get lost.
Should be around here somewhere... After thoroughly studying the island's
map, particularly the vicinity around his school, John felt like he knew the
area very well.
As he walked, he finally spotted what he was looking for - a sign that read
"Fluorite Flower Store," nestled among several other shops in a bustling

complex. Smart placement. Situating the store amidst other businesses
increases its chances of attracting customers.
Flowers weren't a necessity in most people's lives, especially in this city.
While some people went out of their way to buy them, the number was
relatively small compared to the general population.
There are a total of four major flower stores on this island. A public garden
exists too. Out of the commercial four, only this one has a net worth and a
customer base exceeding the trite range expected of the flower stores here.
Its success likely resulted from its strategic location. By setting up where
other necessities were sold, more people were inclined to step into the store.
It was all about convenience. Humans are creatures of convenience, after
all. There are other contributing factors, but this location is… ah, I got
carried away.
He shook his head and refocused. Why was he dwelling on such mundane
things? Perhaps he could simply return to tasking his brain with more
complex activities?
"I'll just get what I came for," he mumbled as he navigated the busy
streets. He ignored the curious looks he received due to his uniform, not
particularly concerned about them.
It was getting late, so he needed to hurry anyway.
With determination, John quickly reached the flower store. The vivid mix of
yellows and oranges, warm hues designed to capture attention, left him in
awe as he entered through the store's glassy doors.
Inside, a crowd of customers explored the variety of flowers on display.
John inwardly noted how other stores must envy the steady flow of
customers there.
He smoothly blended into the crowd, appreciating the store's simplicity. The
interior was plainer than its exterior suggested, but John understood that
customers were more interested in the flowers than aesthetics, and in that
regard, the store delivered.
The space was adorned with numerous potted flowers, ranging from
delicate sunflowers to majestic lilies. Rare varieties were also displayed,

including the elusive purple hibiscus he had recently discussed with
Charlotte. Alongside the flowers, there were vases and glass jars available
for purchase.
That was what he was here for, right? Violet, his cherished flower, was
probably wilting faster in his pocket.
This one looks perfect. John's eyes landed on an ornate vase, even though it
already had a flower. He selected it and joined the queue leading to the
counter, where two cheerful attendants efficiently served the customers.
About six people were queued up in two lines, so John realized he had to
wait his turn. He figured a relatively small store like the one he was in
could only afford to employ two cashiers due to their impressive profit
margin.
"Oh, the queue is already moving," he said quietly, surprised at the
quick service. In no time, John found himself at the counter. He was greeted
by a cheerful woman. Her kind words put him at ease, and she processed
his purchase swiftly.
As she diligently carried out her work, John couldn't help but study the
woman's face. Those facial wrinkles... She's been through a lot lately, hasn't
she? Lack of sleep, those bags under her eyes... Her smile is probably
forced, too.
"Here you go," her voice reeled him back to the present, and he returned
her smile with one of his own. Student IDs weren't accepted for off-campus
transactions, so he paid in cash.
"Thank you for your purchase," she said with another smile, and John
responded in kind.
Even though he should have moved aside for the next customer, a question
lingered.
"Excuse me, do you know where I can find the trash? I need to dispose
of something."
"Oh? Is it organic or inorganic?" Her sweet, attentive tone was soothing.
"Inorganic," John replied promptly, and she pointed him to a discreet
corner with the waste bins. Most people wouldn't even notice it. However,

John had spotted it the moment he walked into the store.
‘That's why I decided to ask. It seems more natural that way,’ John thought
to himself as he thanked the kind lady and left the line, making way for the
next customer holding a pot of lilies. They smell nice.
As he walked away, John's thoughts lingered on the cashier who had
attended to him. He wondered what might have caused her distress and
considered whether frequent visits might uncover the mystery.
‘No, there’s no need for me to know,’ He concluded with a sigh.
Thus, he let go of another of the countless incomplete stories in his head
and moved toward the waste bin. Some stories, he thought, were meant to
remain untold, like flower petals carried away by the wind.
Since he held his flower vase in his left hand, John used his unoccupied
right hand to retrieve the trash from his corresponding pocket. It was a
simple task to remove the crumpled object and dispose of it neatly.
Plain and simple, it was done.
About time… Finally free from the flower store's confines, John couldn't
help but exhale with relief and sport a contented smile. He had obtained
exactly what he came for, and as he stepped out into the bustling street, he
noticed the evening settling in, casting shadows across the cityscape.
Time had flown; he had taken his sweet time, indeed.
5:03 PM. He glanced at his watch, realizing his grandfather must be gearing
up to prepare dinner. I’ll get home in time for the preparation. John knew
he'd be expected to help in the kitchen.
Did he really want to though?
I'll head back home by 5:24, he decided. I'll give myself an extra ten
minutes to enjoy the outdoors. When I get back, I'll take a quick shower, get
dressed, and head downstairs. By 5:52 PM, I'll be ready, and dinner will be
served at 6:00 PM. All I’ll have to do is set the table.
A mischievous smile appeared on his face as he thought about the delicious
meal waiting for him—his grandfather's cooking was truly delightful.
Lost in thoughts of home and the delicious meal, nothing else seemed to
matter to him. John didn't even think about the potential trouble he might

get into for taking a flower from the school garden or the strangers who
passed by and glanced in his direction.
Or even Violet, who was already buried in the trash at the flower shop he
had just left.
He cleared his mind of those thoughts and focused on what he considered
most important at the moment.
‘Sorry, Charlotte,’ he thought, ‘It's not that I don't care about flowers.’
In reality, he did care. He knew more about flowers than most people,
enough to pass as a true flower enthusiast. Of course, professional botanists
and experts in the field understood them better than he did. There might be
new information about flowers that he hadn't come across since his last
research.
However, he still possessed substantial knowledge about them. Flowers
were fascinating, and the new purple hibiscus in his lovely vase was no
exception. So, yes, he cared about flowers.
But what's the point?
People care about breathing, yet they constantly pollute the environment.
They value their health but make unhealthy choices. Everyone desires
success, yet their decisions often lead in the opposite direction.
This inconsistency was a part of humanity, so why would John be an
exception?
The purple hibiscus situation was crucial. It influenced her perception
significantly because it introduced a new variable. John remembered how
Charlotte had sweetly offered to help him obtain the flower, and his eyes
brightened at the thought.
The same flower that could be found in a store—though only in one of the
four that existed in the city. So, yes, in that context, I love flowers.
He found it sweet how she teased him about the purple hibiscus he cradled
like a baby. It was also nice that they could discuss so many topics that she
didn't even pay attention to the flower after a while.
Everything had been perfect.
‘And now we’re friends,’ John’s smile broadened.

His grandfather was right, after all. All he had to do was make a friend, and
everything fell into place. It was amazing how intelligent Dr. Matthew
Lucien was. Sometimes, John felt like he couldn’t compete with the old
man.
Charlotte trusts me a great deal now. Thanks to the experiences we shared,
she perceives my actions with a certain bias. John realized how many steps
he had skipped in befriending a girl who should have been hard to
approach. He had carefully observed her and played his part well, resulting
in a perfectly orchestrated series of events.
She was even the one who offered friendship, and to think she also made
‘that’ statement.
John thought back on her words, something he hadn't heard before.
"You're a good person, John." Her words echoed in his mind like a sweet
melody.
"Am I… a good person?" He pondered silently, maintaining his pace.
He replayed her words in his mind, wondering how much of the statement
was true.
Was he genuinely a good person, or was it merely what she saw; what he
chose to show her?
I wonder… The cheerful smile on the face of the boy slowly faded, and his
tired jaws moved a little as he covered his face with his hands. It was as if
he had just removed a well-crafted mask.
He couldn't help but feel the strain in his facial muscles from maintaining a
smile for so long.
His facial muscles ached. As expected, smiling for so long hurts.
It only lasted a few seconds, though. His smile returned not long after, and
with it came a new topic he could finally consider.
Then, there’s the issue of Mary Anne. Mary, with her striking peach-colored
hair, invaded his thoughts. She’s quite brilliant. Or am I overthinking it?
John recalled the moment Mary Anne insinuated that it was common
knowledge that the special class was actually an exercise, a notion she
presented quite compellingly.

As a result, Charlotte succumbed to the illusion Mary Anne was trying to
create. Right now, she’s probably thinking Class 1A is far ahead of our
class, but that’s just what the opposition wants us to believe.
As for why they wanted to deceive John and his classmates, there were a
few possible reasons. First, making them feel inferior could lead to poor
decisions and preconceived biases in the future.
To John, overestimating an opponent was as dangerous as underestimating
them.
And Mary just made us—or, at least Charlotte—overestimate her class.
That was why he was impressed with the girl, despite his meeting her for
the first time. Observing her mannerisms, speech, and confidence had
revealed some things about her personality, sparking his curiosity.
Since she approached us, I might as well…
A smile spread across his face as he vividly imagined Mary. She was not
only very pretty but also composed, something he couldn't say about
Charlotte.
Is she the leader of Year 1A? That would make a lot of sense. Still, I
shouldn’t conclude yet. It didn’t matter, at this point, for John.
Everything was just speculation anyway.
Until the exercise itself, and till he could gather more information, all he
could do was play around with his thoughts and construct scenarios in his
head.
Should I ask Vida? Well, maybe I shouldn’t play that card yet. John smiled
as he remembered the face of the nice senior he had met during one of his
adventures in the cafeteria; the same one he had accompanied to the library.
She told me a lot of interesting things last time. But, I shouldn’t rush things.
Not yet… Friendship took time to blossom.
I need to consider all my options. Since his house was still a distance away,
and he had over ten minutes to get home, John decided to task his mind a
little.
Thinking about this should be enough to pass the time…

CHAPTER 7
IDENTITY
Identity is a product of collective expression, and cannot exist in isolation. Yet, when surrounded by
too many variables, clarity can be lost, leaving behind a sense of ambiguity.

BZZZTTZZZ!!!

In a vast, blindingly white room, a piercing alarm-like noise shattered the
silence, enough to make anyone jump. The place seemed to stretch on
forever, with spotless white tiles covering every inch of the floor, walls, and
ceiling, creating an eerie, almost otherworldly feeling of pure brightness.
Among the room's notable features were the intercoms, hidden against the
white backdrop on all four walls, relentlessly emitting a deafening sound.
Though they tried to blend in with the white room, keen observers would be
able to spot the tiny speaker holes, revealing their presence.
Standing on opposite walls, two imposing doors stood. One was on the right
side, the other on the left, separated by a considerable distance of about a
hundred meters, underscoring the sheer enormity of this mysterious space.
As if responding to the blaring sound, streams of teenagers began to pour in
through the respective doors. Their school uniforms proudly showcased
black blazers adorned with golden school crests. Clutching their schoolissued tablets, they filled the room with a palpable sense of anticipation.
As the students paused and took in the scene, surprise painted their faces, as
if they hadn't expected to see their rivals there. This was likely the case,
given how they also took a moment to size up their surroundings.

The students gazed around the vast white room, taking in its pristine beauty,
which served as a stark reminder of their privileged status as Richardson
Elite Academy students. The institution was the pinnacle of modern
education, and the white room was the designated space for what they had
been led to believe was a "special class" — an exercise some had already
guessed to be a class activity.
However, could any of them have foreseen this turn of events? The fact that
their rival class stood before them, or that they found themselves alone in
such a vast auditorium? Likely not. This was far from the kind of special
class or class exercise they had expected on an early Saturday morning.
And so, the lingering, unanswered question hung in the air like an
unshakable pest: What in the world was about to happen?
______________________________________

A white room. What an interesting choice. John thought to himself with a
smile.
There was something about the color that radiated serenity and comfort, a
quiet calmness that relaxed the mind. However, he couldn't overlook the
irony that white could also symbolize the opposite of tranquility, as he knew
from the concept of White Torture.
While his fellow students marveled at the room, John's mind ventured down
a different path. He observed his surroundings with a keen, critical eye,
analyzing every detail.
A class exercise is going to happen here. Also, it’s going to be a competition
involving Year 1A. So far, I see nothing out of the ordinary. John's gaze
lingered on the intercoms mounted on the walls.
Based on his observations, there appeared to be no visible cameras, but that
seemed improbable. The school authorities must have been monitoring the
students using some method, and cameras were typically essential. Twoway mirrors might have been an alternative, but since John couldn't spot
any, he could only assume that hidden cameras were in use.
How then? Did they make the cameras inconspicuous enough not to be
noticed? Most likely.

Preventing cameras from being easily spotted was not too difficult a task,
and the room's white surroundings certainly contributed to that effort, so
John decided not to dwell on it.
After all, it was all speculative at this point.
The air conditioner is subtly hidden in the ceiling vents. It blends perfectly
with the bright, bare room. Its careful camouflage might have gone
unnoticed by most, but John's meticulous attention to detail allowed him to
spot it, along with the subtle direction of the gentle breeze.
After surveying the room, John's gaze shifted to the girl beside him,
Charlotte Olivia.
Although her eyes held a hint of surprise, she admirably maintained her
composure. Her attention was fixed on a particular Year 1A student, a girl
with striking peach-pink hair and a self-assured demeanor. John recognized
her as Mary Anne, whom they had briefly met the day before.
"I guess she also expected this…" John's hushed words reached
Charlotte, and she abruptly broke her locked gaze with Mary Anne. Slowly
turning toward him, she found his unassuming, smiling face awaiting her. A
mix of emotions played across her expression, revealing there was a
significant reason for her reaction.
"You were right, John. H-how did you know...?" Charlotte's eyes darted
around cautiously, ensuring their conversation remained private, but her
flustered demeanor was unmistakable.
It was entirely understandable why Charlotte was taken aback. Just the day
before, John had shared his thoughts about the special class, and he
mentioned something important, something she was now witnessing
unfolding before her eyes. He had predicted this exact outcome.
"It's not surprising. Look around you, Charlotte. Look at our
classmates," John remarked.
With a curious gaze, Charlotte surveyed the room, taking note of many
students either being rowdy, whispering to each other, or simply gawking at
their unfamiliar surroundings. Some were audibly grumbling about their
ruined weekend plans. However, amid the chaos, a select few appeared
entirely unfazed by the situation.

Mia Elena stood out among them, exuding an air of absolute calm, if not
perhaps even elation. Ben Elias, Noah Louis, and a handful of others also
had the same collected facial expressions.
"The school might have conducted this exercise—or a variant of it—
for our seniors previously. It's not impossible to obtain prior knowledge
from those who've gone through it," John explained with a knowing smile,
his gaze shifting toward the Year 1A students. "I'm sure our rival class is
aware of it too."
In stark contrast to the mixed reactions among Year 1B, Year 1A students
displayed remarkable uniformity in their composure. Not a single person
seemed surprised beyond the initial moments of entering the designated
room for the class exercise. They all exuded confidence and smugness, as
one would expect from a group holding such a clear advantage.
John's attention returned to Charlotte, who appeared troubled for some
unknown reason.
"What's the matter?" he inquired.
"I just... I'm surprised. If they knew this much, why did no one say
anything? Wouldn't it benefit everyone if the entire class knew? This is a
class exercise, after all," she whispered, her worry escalating.
John wasn't taken aback by Charlotte's reaction to the few who kept silent
about the impending event. Having observed her personality, he knew this
was in line with her character. Unlike them, she freely shared her
observations on the first day of school, guiding the class in the right
direction.
If only more students were like her, perhaps their class would have an even
better chance. Not that John truly believed in such an approach, but he
valued the sentiment.
"Individuals tend to hoard knowledge that can be beneficial to the
group," he explained. The reasons behind this behavior could vary, from a
desire for power and control to a sense of superiority.
But in John's case, the reason for his silence was a simple one—apathy.
"I understand, John. You don't want to say anything because you're still
trying to understand the full picture, right? You're following your

philosophy," Charlotte answered, her gaze still unfocused.
The realization brought an even wider smile to John's face.
She's making excuses for me, without even thinking about it. Her bias
towards me is different now. To Charlotte, I'm a good person, so even if my
actions are neutral—as long as they're open to interpretation—she'll justify
them to fit her 'good person' image of me. It made John deeply appreciate
Charlotte’s friendship.
It meant the world to him.
"You're absolutely right, Charlotte."
BZZZZZTTZZZ!!!
But then, a sudden interruption disrupted the classroom. A sharp, hushed
buzz sliced through the air, causing every student to freeze in confusion.
Their hearts raced, and they exchanged bewildered glances. What was
happening? Why this unexpected disturbance?
Welcome, students. As you must have deciphered already, you will not be
having any real class today, though there could be a lesson learned by the
end of this exercise. The voice that emerged from the intercom speakers
sounded masculine, but nothing about it sounded familiar to those who
listened.
The voice paused, allowing the weight of his cryptic words to sink in,
leaving the students grappling with the mystery of what awaited them.
As expected, the students' reactions varied greatly.
Year 1A students remained composed and unsurprised.
Year 1B, on the other hand, erupted into chaos. Some felt disappointed by
the announcement, while others were frightened, excited, or simply
disinterested. Despite the multitude of reactions, no one dared to speak. It
was clear that their scores might be affected by any unruliness, so the
students remained silent, erring on the side of caution.
For those who haven’t already figured it out, this will be a competitive
class exercise. In essence, your classes will be competing for the points
that will be awarded in this exercise. And, of course, it will be graded.

The students gulped nervously, and beads of perspiration formed on their
faces.
If Class A wins, they will be awarded the point, and B will simply not be
awarded any points, and vice versa. You must understand that this is
aimed at recording Class Performance. Your failure or success here does
not mean that any mark will be added or deducted from your individual
scores. Finally, both classes can fail or excel. It all depends on how well
you perform.
John noticed how unusual the school's approach was in giving detailed
instructions to the students.
He had expected something more like the surprise event their homeroom
teacher had pulled on their first day—a trick he assumed Year 1A had also
experienced.
Unlike this exercise, where all the rules and conditions were explained
plainly, the impromptu exercise had been sprung on them suddenly. Those
who saw it coming had to pick up on subtle clues from what the teacher had
said before the exercise itself.
To be fair, this is somewhat similar. Those who saw this exercise coming
must have been really observant, and actively investigating. Plus, we still
don't know what we'll have to do.
According to an upperclassman he had asked, even their seniors had gotten
different exercises. So, John didn't expect their class to face the same
challenge their predecessors did. They were all lost in a web of speculation
so intricate that the rules needed to be as clear as possible.
As such, John paid close attention to the words from the intercom,
preparing for the possibility that he might never hear them again.
Now, without wasting more of your time, let's get to the exercise. Year 1A
and Year 1B, you'll be playing a simple game of 'Spot The Imposter.' I'm
sure you've all heard of this concept or played a similar game.
John and a few others instantly understood the reference. Unfortunately, the
nature of the game, specifically how it related to the students, remained a
mystery to most of the curious audience.

By now, you must have noticed that Class A is mostly made up of
returning students from this school's Middle School, while Class B is
filled with newcomers. This information is correct, but only to a certain
extent.
In each class, there is an exception. Your task as a class is to identify the
two exceptions: one in your class and one in the other class.
Gasps and exclamations filled the room as the students struggled to grasp
this revelation.
Of course, they quickly silenced themselves, but it emphasized the
seriousness of the situation. John discreetly glanced around and noticed that
even students like Mia, Noah, and Ben were getting flustered. It was
evident that they, too, had not anticipated this twist.
However, unlike the rest, John hardly reacted to the news. Whether he was
surprised, flustered, or scared, no one could tell. He maintained his cheerful
demeanor and continued listening to the voice on the intercom.
You have ten minutes to discuss this as a class. Afterward, use your tablets
to vote. If at least seventy percent of the class agrees on both imposters'
identities, the class wins. Also, remember to communicate in a way that
the other class can't get information from your team.
If a student is caught sharing information with the other class, they will
be removed, and their scores will be deducted.
Once the ten minutes are up, you'll have one minute to type the imposters'
names on your tablets. No communication within your group will be
allowed at that point.
Now that all the rules have been explained, you may begin.
And just like that…
BZZZTTTZZZZ!!!
… The clock began to tick!

______________________________________

Interesting. So this is how they want to play it. John couldn't help but smile
with a sense of understanding as he closed his eyes briefly, savoring the
charged atmosphere in the room.
A sense of intrigue danced across his face, and his heart raced with
anticipation. It was his first-ever competition among his peers, and the
excitement of competition thrilled him.
It was exhilarating.
Sure, he had some reservations about the test's seemingly low difficulty
level and the abundance of information given to the students. However,
considering it was their first competitive class exercise, John concluded that
it was probably for the best.
‘All we have to do is simple,’ he thought to himself, his strategic mind
already at work. ‘Identify the imposters based on the information we
already have or gather during this exercise.’
The exercise was cleverly split into two parts. The first task was to uncover
the impostor amidst their own classmates, and the second was to reveal the
impostor hidden within Class A.
John considered which task might prove more challenging, contemplating
the nuances of both.
In his opinion, both tasks were equally challenging, but he knew some of
his peers might feel differently. The main concern for John was that there
was one group that would also find these tasks equally challenging.
One of our classmates attended Middle School in this academy, while one of
Year 1A’s members is a new entrant. There’s an obvious imbalance in this
exercise, isn’t it?
"Year 1A has a clear advantage! Is this even fair?" Charlotte blurted out,
expressing what John had been thinking.
Charlotte's face showed her frustration with the rules and the nature of their
Class Exercise. It was probably the first time John had ever seen her so
upset, so he quietly observed her.

"Everyone, let's gather around and figure this out," Ben Elias said, his
strong voice cutting through the commotion and grabbing the attention of
his classmates.
John and Charlotte, like the other 1B students, heard Ben's voice and felt
the attention shift toward him. John was intrigued by how Ben handled the
chaotic situation, becoming the center of attention due to taking the first
step.
As a result, all his classmates turned their focus to Ben, waiting to hear
what he would say or do.
"I understand what you're all thinking, and you're right," Ben declared
with a firm and unwavering voice. "This exercise is biased in favor of Class
A."
“While we were only introduced to each other on the first day of
school, they've known one another since their Middle School days. It gives
them a significant advantage in identifying the familiar faces and spotting
the imposter among us."
Ben's words resonated with those who hadn't yet fully grasped the
seriousness of their situation. The reality of the challenge they faced began
to sink in, and their initial impulse to protest was silenced by the sobering
awareness that their class results were on the line.
"I don't understand why the Academy would spring this on us now, but
there's no denying we're at a disadvantage," Ben continued, his frustration
evident in his tone. Unlike the hopeful words Charlotte had shared on their
first day, Ben was now shedding light on the harsh reality they were dealing
with. It was a far cry from the ideal academic life they were promised.
John couldn't help but think to himself, ‘What is he doing? No, rather, what
is he saying? He's wrong.’ As he stared at Charlotte's distraught face, he
realized she must be grappling with the fact that she had misunderstood the
nature of Richardson Elite Academy.
According to her earlier words, this school was supposed to be free of
favoritism, and all its actions were meant to be fair. However, in the face of
this appalling situation, she had to eat her words.
It was crystal clear that Class A had the upper hand, evident to everyone.

Everyone but John.
I agree that this situation appears to align with Ben’s narrative. In fact, this
competition is truly in 1A’s favor. That changes nothing though. It doesn’t
diminish the exceptional nature of this school, or its clearly outstanding
educational system. John wasn't justifying bias; he was merely surprised
that his classmates failed to see the bigger picture.
Who's to say that the next competition won't swing in our favor? Wouldn't
that balance things out? We have exactly ten weeks of school activities each
term, and we there are four terms. If we divide them equally, both classes
will have equal opportunities to shine. Since this is probably a weekly
contest, it's certain that there will be an even number of tests.
John knew it was easy for all this information to get lost in the chaos, but he
hoped some of his classmates would figure it out, at the very least. Maybe
there were students who had spotted this anomaly but, like him, had chosen
to stay silent.
Apathy wasn't exclusive to him, after all.
At this rate, though, the class will operate on the assumption that this is
Class A’s undisputed victory. Yes, it’s quite certain already that 1A will win
this round unless they’re a bunch of idiots. I highly doubt that, though.
Still, that doesn’t make this an automatic loss for us.
John remembered the moderator's words that both classes could win.
Instead of dwelling on the unfairness of the situation, he believed they
should be looking for ways to win.
Winning now meant leveling the playing field in the next exercise, where
1B would have a better chance of outshining Class A instead of settling for
a tie.
If we win, it’ll make our scores match 1A. That is, an even 1-1. In the next
exercise, there’s a high likelihood that we’ll get a 2-1. It’s also possible that
1A will pull through and we’ll be stuck in a 2-2 draw. But, isn’t that much
better than accepting defeat and scoring a zero?
If they clung to this assumption and managed to win the next round, it
would only put them on equal footing with Year 1A, or, even worse, 1A
might still emerge as the victors.

John hated the thought of settling for mediocrity; he hungered for a clear
and decisive win. However, upon reflection, he realized that he only
considered something a loss when he was actively involved in it. This was
evident from his interactions with his class, and even during this intense
exercise, John remained on the fence.
While everyone around him was gasping, sweating, and struggling with the
task, giving their all to find a solution, John stayed calm, observing their
efforts with a knowing smile. I don’t feel the need to exert myself to the
same extent.
Shrugging internally, he kept his vow of silence.
After all, I already know the answer.
______________________________________

Charlotte found herself in a puzzling situation.
As Ben and the group brainstormed, attempting to uncover the identity of
the imposter, their efforts seemed fruitless. Every suggestion was met with a
counter-argument, leaving them at an impasse. The usual methods of
identification, such as ID cards and showing their tablets, proved unhelpful.
Even Charlotte's attempt to connect the imposter to the name faker hit a
dead end when Ben and others pointed out that time was running out. The
clock was ticking, and they couldn't afford to entertain speculative
solutions.
While everyone's tablets were up and running, Charlotte's mind was in
disarray. She thought about unlocking the tablets with their ID cards, but
her earlier conversation with John made her hesitant. Revealing the name
faker might not be wise just yet, as they could be unrelated to the imposter.
‘That is too risky. Argh! It's all so confusing,’ Charlotte thought to herself,
surrendering to the logical and practical solutions that led to dead ends.
How could they possibly achieve anything in just ten minutes?
As her thoughts swirled, Charlotte's gaze involuntarily drifted toward John.
Something about his smile and calm demeanor triggered a long-ignored
thought in her mind, something she should have considered much earlier.

"Psst! Hey, John," she whispered, making him jump in surprise. Charlotte
couldn't help but find his reaction cute, but she quickly focused on the
important reason she sought him out.
"Hey, John. Do you have any ideas to help us find the culprit? Any
method we can use to—"
"Oh, that. I already know who they are," John casually interjected,
giving her his signature look – an unassuming smile accompanied by
innocent, child-like eyes.
Charlotte was completely taken aback, bewildered by John's statement.
"W-what are you saying, John? You know who the culprits are?" she
asked, her curiosity at its peak.
Charlotte made sure to keep her voice low amidst the chaos, confident that
no one would overhear amid the commotion. Mia, engrossed in a meeting
with her inner circle, and Ben, dealing with the noisy crowd, were both too
busy to notice her.
In stark contrast to the surrounding chaos, Class A appeared calm and
composed, exuding confidence. They seemed almost uninterested, as if they
didn't need the ten minutes of deliberation. Watching Class B lose their
minds seemed to amuse them.
But Charlotte's focus returned to her conversation with John. Emotions and
thoughts swirled within her as she gazed at him, and a simple question
echoed in her mind.
Why?
If John already knew who the imposters were, why wasn't he sharing this
crucial information with the class? Why wasn't he offering assistance when
they needed it the most? Her perception of John as a good person clashed
with his current actions, and she struggled to understand his motives.
Why was he keeping this valuable information to himself? She yearned to
hear his explanation before making any judgments.
"I want to say something, but… it wouldn't work in this situation," John
replied, his words tinged with a hint of sadness. Charlotte couldn't quite
grasp the meaning behind such a cryptic response.

"What do you mean?" she asked, encouraging him to explain.
"I know who the imposters are, and my conclusions are based on valid
reasons. But with only six minutes left, there's not enough time to share my
discovery with everyone, explain the process behind it, and prevent
interference from the impostor. Mishandling this delicate situation would
only cause more confusion," John explained, with a hint of concern in his
eyes.
Charlotte stood there, her mind filled with a mix of understanding, respect,
and empathy for John. It all fell into place now—the reason for his silence,
the burden he carried on his shoulders.
He was in pain, wrestling with inner conflict, and yet, he chose to shield his
classmates at any cost. At that moment, she admired him more than ever. If
Charlotte were in his shoes, she knew she would have blurted out
everything without a second thought, consequences be damned. But John
considered the bigger picture, the potential consequences of revealing the
truth to a confused and easily swayed audience.
"Most importantly, I'm not a reliable source. I'm just a class loner. Even
if I manage to give a reasonable explanation, someone with more influence
can easily discredit me. It feels hopeless," John softly stated.
‘It's not fair,’ she thought, completely agreeing with him.
The fact that John had even identified the imposters was close to a miracle.
But who would believe him? A class loner with little influence? It felt like
an uphill battle.
"Unfortunately, I'm not you or Ben," John confessed, and it struck a
chord with Charlotte.
His last statement, along with his earlier words, began to resonate in
Charlotte's mind. Everything slowly started making sense.
As the minutes passed, the plan crystallized in Charlotte's thoughts. It was a
breakthrough she wouldn't have reached without her conversation with
John, some self-reflection, and keen observation of her classmates.
"John, I have an idea," she said, her face radiating excitement. She
moved closer to him, unable to contain her enthusiasm. This plan had the
potential to rescue the class from this predicament.

"Do you trust me?" she asked, hoping for a positive response. John's
smile remained warm and endearing, as always.
"Of course, I trust you. You're my friend."
That simple declaration filled Charlotte with joy and determination. She
wanted to hug him tightly but kept herself composed. Time was running
out. With John's knowledge and her strategic mind, they could make a
difference.
"Tell me the names of the imposters," she urged, her heart pounding
with anticipation. "You can explain everything later. Just tell me who they
are, and leave the rest to me!”
______________________________________

Looks like she took the hint. John couldn't help but smile with pride as he
watched Charlotte gracefully navigate through the bustling crowd.
He knew exactly what she was planning to do, and he saw it as the perfect
solution to their current problem. Charlotte aimed to bridge the gap between
his lack of reputation and the daunting test that their class faced.
The hierarchical ladder. Charlotte has fallen from her position at the top,
but she’s still very influential and trustworthy.
Of course, John knew she wasn’t influential enough to convince the entire
class. However, the trick to her plan was the fact that she didn’t need to. It
was such a chore explaining to everyone, especially when opposition was
bound to be thrown at her.
With less than four minutes left, it was better to simply take the most
efficient route possible.
Engaging with those who possess the required influence. That should do the
trick. There were currently three people in the class who possessed what
John considered the highest amount of influence. They practically
monopolized the class dynamics. Ben, Mia, and Charlotte. In that order.
Ben had seen his status rise due to the ongoing situation, and he had the
potential to maintain that influence regardless of the outcome of the
exercise.

Mia's reputation and influence were closely linked, and from what John
observed, she held a vital position within the class. On the other hand,
Charlotte, due to recent personal troubles, had seen a drop in her social
standing, making her the least influential among the trio.
Recently, her influence has dropped significantly. She doesn’t participate
much in class activities, and she always seems distracted. She seems
troubled by something, and it has affected her popularity. That makes her
the least influential among the trio. If she is to sway the entire class, she’ll
need the assistance of either one, or both parties. Upon closer examination
of Charlotte's options, it became quite clear to John which person she would
choose.
In fact, Charlotte was talking to him at the moment. Her choice was none
other than Ben Elias.
It would be much more difficult to convince Mia, anyway. Besides, she has a
history with Ben thanks to the whole ‘fake name’ incident. Charlotte and
Ben had a rapport, exchanging small talk from time to time. Moreover,
Ben's opinion of Charlotte appeared to be positive, based on their
interactions in class.
Ben’s best interest aligns with keeping his actions consistent. Although, I
have not completely figured out his intentions, but at the very least, he
intends to keep helping the class out. As such, he should be willing to hear
Charlotte out. Whether or not he would give her the benefit of the doubt
was another question entirely, but John was convinced that if anyone could
present a compelling argument using the persuasive ability of rhetoric, it
was Charlotte.
John's gaze remained locked onto the private exchange unfolding between
Charlotte and Ben. Even as Mia attempted to steal the spotlight, eager for
her moment in the limelight, her efforts inadvertently created a shield of
privacy for Charlotte and Ben's conversation.
Like a skilled detective, John absorbed every detail of their interaction—the
subtle movements of their facial muscles, the graceful exchange of words
on their lips, the rhythmic blinking of their eyes, the direction of their
gazes, and the fluidity of their postures. Even without hearing a single
word, their unspoken dialogue spoke volumes.

Finally, the conversation came to an end.
‘Well done, Charlotte. You did it, just as I knew you would,’ John thought.
With both Charlotte and Ben on the same page, Mia would have no other
choice but to come on board. With no alternative in sight, they would
follow the charismatic Ben, the evidently intelligent Charlotte, and
whatever role Mia was meant to play in the class.
Amidst his analytical thoughts, John's gaze met Charlotte's. Her smile grew
wider, and she gave him a wink.
BA-DUM!
H-huh…? John felt an unexpected reaction stirring within him.
A warm sensation spread through John's body, especially on his face. His
heart had undeniably leaped with excitement right then, and a cozy feeling
enveloped him, particularly his cheeks. The look of contentment and relief
on Charlotte's face brought him an inexplicable sense of fulfillment. It was
a feeling he knew he would never forget.
‘This is nice,’ John thought, returning her smile with a wink of his own.
As Ben and Charlotte rejoined the crowd, announcing their supposed joint
conclusion, John's mind remained focused on the whirlwind of emotions
within him.
He wondered if this was what friendship meant, pondering the warm and
energetic feeling that had taken root inside him. It was an indescribable
surge of excitement, unlike anything he had ever experienced before. At
last, he felt a connection to this elusive phenomenon. Having a friend was
entirely new territory for him.
Lost in his thoughts, John failed to notice when their allotted time came to
an end.
BZZZTZZZZ!!!
The alarm from the intercom rang out.
At that point, there was only one thing left for the students to do.
It was time to cast their votes.

______________________________________

Your responses have been recorded, and the results have been collated.
The results for this week’s class exercise will now be announced.
The students now awaited the big reveal. On one end, participants were
nervous and uncertain. They had followed the guidance of their leaders
because they had no better option. None of them knew the answer, and
failure was not an option.
Ben and Charlotte were seen as intelligent and trustworthy, with the class'
best interests at heart.
It was only logical to heed their advice.
However, despite their earlier confidence in this approach, the resultant
uncertainty had left them all somewhat flustered. The surprising nature of
the class exercise had caught them off guard, and the students were now
showing signs of unease.
It didn't matter that they were considered geniuses; being caught off-guard
was simply a normal part of life's twists and turns.
The way the proctor casually mentions ‘this week’s exercise’ should give us
a hint that there would be another one awaiting us next week. I mean, those
who asked the seniors already know this, but this should serve as a subtle
tip for those who were unaware. John thought to himself.
Observing the room's tense atmosphere, John deduced that the proctor's
discreet information might have gone unnoticed by many students, who
were preoccupied with the upcoming results.
Understandably so, but he found it unacceptable.
‘I know some people will catch that. Like that girl, Mary Anne,’ he thought
with a smile as he observed her, standing casually among her classmates.
In the white room, Mary's pink hair was like a vibrant splash of color,
adding to her charm. Her petite stature only heightened her allure. But
something was intriguing about her that caught John's attention.
He had been observing her for a while, and he was already making
interesting deductions. She appeared to be the sole leader of Class A, or at

least, that's how it seemed. John couldn't help but notice the stark contrast
between 1A and their counterparts in 1B.
While Mary seemed to be the guiding force, holding Class A together, 1B
was still without a Class Representative or a singular leader.
“Let’s not think about that now,” John told himself. Wasn’t it best to
simply enjoy the moment and anticipate the results?
That’s right, there is no reason to think too hard. The only thing that
mattered at that point was the result.
Class A passes with a total score of a hundred percent. Both imposters
were correctly identified by every member of the class, without exception.
Once again, the unity and excellence of Year 1A amazed John and everyone
in the vast white hall. However, there was no time to dwell on their success.
It was now the underdogs' turn.
Class B also passes with a total score of eighty percent. Both imposters
were guessed correctly by over seventy percent of the class. As a result,
today’s result is… a tie.
The room immediately fell into stunned silence.
Both sides shared expressions of disbelief, but it seemed that, for the first
time that day, 1A bore the brunt of the shock.
Then, an explosion of joy shattered the silence.
The room trembled with the uncontrollable, triumphant roar of victory.
“WOOOOHOOOOOOOOO!!!”
It was Year 1B's victorious shout and a well-deserved one at that.
______________________________________

Chaos filled the large, white hall, echoing with loud voices of happiness and
relief.
Loud voices of excitement and relief erupted among the students. Almost
everyone gathered around Ben to celebrate their achievement. Charlotte,
however, slipped away from the crowd.

A few students preferred to quietly savor their victory.
Amidst all the celebration, two students shared satisfied smiles and playful
winks, clearly showing their close connection and mutual understanding.
"Haha, come on, John, spill the beans. How did you figure out that
Mikail was the imposter in our class?" Charlotte poked her dear friend, her
excitement radiating.
The incredible victory they achieved as a class was all thanks to John's
brilliant insights. However, the question still lingered in her mind: How did
he manage to uncover the truth?
"It all began during Mr. Archibald's opening speech," John started,
capturing Charlotte's attention. Her eyes widened in surprise; she
remembered the homeroom teacher's talk, but he hadn't mentioned an
imposter or any class exercise.
"He used some interesting words. Remember when he said that most of
us were new to the school's surroundings? I started wondering if there was
more to his message than met the eye," John explained.
"Wait, that's it? That's what got you started?" Charlotte couldn't believe
that such a seemingly small detail led to this incredible discovery.
John chuckled, finding amusement in her surprise. "That was just the
beginning. The real investigation happened later. I noticed something odd in
the cafeteria – our imposter seemed to know everything about the Academy.
Then, I saw him hanging out with some seniors and, most importantly, with
a Class 1A student in the library. It was subtle, but I could tell..."
Charlotte was amazed by John's keen observations. It all started with a
casual comment from their teacher, and John's detective instincts took it
from there.
"I thought he was just very friendly, but I never saw his actions as
anything more than that," Charlotte confessed. "He tried to get close to me
too, but I assumed he was just being nice, maybe a bit too eager."
She remembered how she had once suspected Mikail of being a stalker, but
her investigation yielded no results. Now she realized that he must have
been deliberately blending in and making connections to hide his true
identity.

"Then, does that mean he's the—"
"No, he's not the name faker. I wish it were that simple, but the real
culprit is still among us," John interrupted, shaking his head with a smile.
"Think about it. If Mikail were the name faker, we would have all guessed
the wrong name, and he would have won."
“That's true…” Charlotte felt a twinge of embarrassment for missing
such a small detail.
She couldn't help but admire John's keen perception. It seemed like he had a
talent for noticing even the tiniest things others might miss.
Curious to know if John had a specific reason to suspect Mikail, she asked,
"Did you have a reason to suspect Mikail in particular? With so many
students in our class, it must have been tough to narrow it down."
John leaned in, explaining his thought process, "During our class
introductions, Mikail mentioned how excited he was to outdo Class 1A.
That caught my attention, so I made him the focus of my investigation. It
turned out to be a lucky hunch."
Their attention shifted to Mikail, who wore a somber expression,
surrounded by shocked and upset classmates. They probably hadn't
expected such deception from their dear friend.
I'll have to be more observant!
Charlotte resolved to be more attentive in the future, determined not to let
her responsibilities to the class slip amid her other tasks and concerns.
However, a lingering mystery still tugged at Charlotte's mind. "There’s one
mystery that I still can’t figure out..."
John interjected, anticipating her question. "For the Class 1A imposter, I
used a similar process of elimination. But these cases, especially the latter,
rely on subjective and speculative information. Explaining it to everyone
wouldn't have been convincing enough."
"What do you mean?"
"Well, I ran into him on the first day of school. It was actually a
coincidence, and he acted like a newcomer back then. So it was surprising
to see him in Class A despite that."

The more Charlotte heard, the more unbelievable it all seemed. According
to John, it was just a random encounter, and they didn't even exchange a
word. Impressions like that were usually forgettable, but he seemed to
remember everything. As John laid out his reasoning, Charlotte found
herself convinced, even though it sounded like an incredible story.
Yet, the evidence of their class' triumphant victory spoke volumes about
John's brilliance. He keeps amazing me every time.
"Could you do me a favor, Charlotte? Don't tell anyone," John's voice
carried a plea, interrupting her thoughts and adding to her confusion.
Puzzled, she said, "Why would you ask that?"
"Please, it's important to me," John insisted.
"Is this about catching the mastermind behind the fake names, or is
there more to it?" Charlotte inquired.
"It's both. As you've noticed, I'm kind of a loner. I could only make
these deductions because I had no distractions. If everyone knows about it,
it might become overwhelming. I don't want that kind of attention," he
explained.
Once again, John presented a compelling argument for his decision—one
that Charlotte couldn't resist. He always had sound reasons behind his
actions, and he was consistently considerate of others. If he was invested in
unmasking the class imposters, it had to be because he wanted to help the
class. That was just John's nature.
Besides, it was ultimately his choice, wasn't it?
"Alright, I understand," Charlotte said, offering a smile and extending her
fist. John knew exactly what was expected and reciprocated the gesture.
"Thanks!" He extended his fist as well.
And so, in this display of camaraderie, their fists bumped together with a
satisfying thud, and laughter filled the air as they celebrated their
accomplishments.
Once again, they failed to notice someone approaching them. The same girl
who had approached them the day before.

"Congratulations on your achievement. I must admit, I was surprised,"
Mary Anne greeted them, bowing slightly with a perfect curtsy. Her
greeting appeared exceedingly polite, but her smile and intense gaze gave
off a chilling vibe as she looked at Charlotte and John. Her lips curled
further, suggesting that an idea had sparked in her mind.
"Thank you. Likewise," Charlotte responded, mimicking Mary's
greeting with a smile of her own. However, the tension between the two
girls was palpable. It was clear that they didn't particularly like each other,
and though Charlotte believed she concealed her feelings reasonably well,
the same couldn't be said for Mary.
From the corner of her eye, Charlotte noticed the members of Year 1A
huddled together, deep in discussion. Some were inching closer to her and
John, but she pretended not to notice their approach.
"If I may ask, how did you figure out the identities of the imposters?"
Mary still wore her smile. Either she was a terrible actress, or her question
was intentionally pointed, given how straightforward it was.
Mary's polite request was somewhat too direct, and anyone would have
noticed that. Besides...
"Why would I tell you that?" Charlotte retained her smile, her friendly
demeanor unwavering. Her tone was firm, but devoid of disrespect.
“I wasn’t expecting you to.” Mary Anne's response shook her a bit, but
she pretended not to be affected in the slightest.
“I just wanted to gauge your reaction. It's as I suspected, Charlotte. You
were the one who came up with the solution, right? You used your influence
to persuade Ben, who, in turn, convinced everyone else. Am I right?"
Both Mary and Charlotte deepened their smiles, yet the atmosphere
brimmed with tension.
How does she know so much? Charlotte struggled to conceal her surprise.
Mary had to be incredibly clever to have her class rally around her, that
much was clear. But Charlotte hadn't expected her to deduce exactly how
they had won as a class.

"That silence of yours serves as confirmation. It means you had the
ability to figure out their identities. I see. It appears I underestimated you,
Charlotte. You’re smarter than you appear."
Charlotte did her best to hide her surprise. She needed to keep her
composure; showing weakness wasn't an option. Mary was undeniably
brilliant, but what bothered Charlotte was John's lack of support this time.
Why isn't John backing me up? He did so last time, she thought.
Charlotte did her best to avoid glancing in John's direction, keeping her
gaze fixed on Mary. She couldn't deny Mary's intelligence. Luckily, Mary
didn't realize that the real genius was John. That was their class' secret
weapon.
"I'm still curious about how you managed to figure out the identities of
both imposters, but further questions would be pointless," Mary said. With
that, she bowed once more. "Goodbye, Charlotte. I look forward to our next
encounter."
Mary finally left Charlotte alone, returning to Year 1A, whose members
were already waiting for her. Charlotte watched as Mary gave her
classmates a reassuring smile, instilling confidence in them. It made her
realize just how remarkable Mary was.
And just how inadequate she felt.
Am I really fit to lead the class? Can I handle it? That was her initial
intention when she first arrived. She thought that by helping the class unite,
she could do more as their leader. But now, doubt crept into her heart.
Charlotte began to think that someone as analytical and observant as John
would be far more valuable to the class. However, after hearing his
perspective and fully understanding his reasoning, she couldn't argue
against his decision. Besides, John said he was willing to help her if she ran
for Class Representative.
Hold on, where's John?
Charlotte realized that John was nowhere to be found. She could have
sworn he was right next to her just a moment ago.
Where did he go?

"I'm right here," John said, standing beside Charlotte, causing her to
yelp slightly before quickly stifling her reaction.
A faint pink hue appeared on her face as she fought off the unintentional
embarrassment. "W-where did you go? You left me hanging."
"Sorry. I didn't want to interrupt your conversation with Mary. Also, I
noticed the name faker doing something, so I had to take a closer look,"
John replied, his tone calm and unassuming as always, instantly calming her
left-over anxiety.
"And? Did you find anything out?" She asked, curious about his
discoveries.
"A little, but not enough. I guess we'll know more next week. I wonder
what's going on, though. They've announced our results, yet we haven't
been told that the exercise is over." John mumbled his last words as he
scanned the surroundings.
"You're right." Charlotte followed his gaze and noticed the current
situation. Year 1B had stopped celebrating, and most students were engaged
in idle chatter. Year 1A had gathered together for discussions.
"John, we should probably move closer to the main group. We're
straying too far from everyone," she suggested.
"Good idea."
John and Charlotte subtly closed in on their class while continuing their
conversation.
"What do you think this delay means? Do we have another exercise?"
She asked, seeking his opinion.
"I doubt it. Our results have already been announced. If anything,
maybe they're going to make an announcement."
"I thought so. What do you think it's going to be about?" Charlotte
could think of a couple of things, but she wanted to hear John's take on the
matter. With time, she found herself increasingly inclined to trust his
judgment. He was brilliant, and she was becoming very interested in his
perspective on various issues.

"Hmm. If I had to guess, then maybe—" Before John could say more, a
static sound echoed across the hall, followed by a faint buzz.
The proctor's address began.
With the exercise for today concluded, each class will exit the hall in the
direction from which you came. Once you leave, the first thing you should
do is head to your classes to return your tablets to your desks. Afterward,
you are free to enjoy the rest of your day.
Classes will resume next week on Monday, as a matter of course.
Excited grins spread among the students, but Charlotte glanced at John. His
expression suggested there was more to come, perhaps the most crucial
part.
As an important notice, the students whom you've identified as imposters
will be transferred to their rightful classes. In essence, the imposter from
Year 1A will be placed in Year 1B, and vice versa.
John's grin widened a little, and Charlotte assumed this was what he was
expecting. To be honest, she also sort of expected this outcome.
To think our Class will be getting someone from 1A. This has its merits and
demerits, depending on the person. On the plus side, they would have
access to information on their opponent class if they received someone who
was previously one of the opposition. The new member that was to join
their class would have no choice but to spill the beans if he wanted his new
class to have an advantage over 1A. He'll need us to do well to get good
grades and be promoted to the next class.
Unfortunately, this scenario worked as an advantage for both parties. Year
1A would also have a mole who would feed them information on 1B. Both
sides had things to lose. Everything depended on the cooperation of this
person.
With this in mind, Charlotte observed the imposter from Class A. He didn't
appear out of place among their group. His red hair was slightly disheveled,
and his athletic physique matched his well-defined face. He also had a tan
complexion.
But the most striking feature was his sharp, intimidating gaze.

Something tells me he's going to be a handful. Charlotte thought to herself,
suppressing her unease.
However, she reminded herself, ‘He'll have no choice but to cooperate.
Fifty percent of his grades depend on our class' performance. As long as he
doesn't want to fail, he'll help us, no matter what.’ She could only hope he
could be reasoned with. Class 1B didn't need any additional problems.
That concludes the announcements. Ensure you comport yourselves as
students. Have a lovely day.
The moment their proctor finished speaking, the doors behind each class
swung open, and students eagerly streamed out of the hall, their excitement
palpable as they looked forward to the rest of the weekend.
Even the students of 1A weren't immune to this energy. Their smiles and
bustling excitement confirmed that they too were teenagers with needs.
"Let's go, John," Charlotte's heart raced for some inexplicable reason.
She took John's hand, and they quickly joined the flow of students exiting
the hall. But before leaving, Charlotte cast one final glance over her
shoulder, observing Mary and her classmates exiting through the other door.
In an almost strange coincidence, the peach-blond girl looked back as well.
Their gazes met, and for a brief moment, a silent understanding passed
between them. Charlotte couldn't help but think about how formidable Mary
was, and she was certain that Mary had a similar perception of her. The
other girl broke into a sly smile before turning away and disappearing
behind the white door.
"Come on, Charlotte. We should head out too," John nudged her,
bringing her back from her intense focus on Mary—or, more accurately, her
observation of her.
"Ah, yes. Let's go."
So, John and Charlotte, their faces beaming, passed through the white door
and vanished into the hallway before them. Their smiles were not only due
to the success of their first Class Exercise but also the excitement for the
rest of their weekend.
Despite everything that had just transpired, it was still a Saturday.

______________________________________

John waited patiently for Charlotte, observing from a distance as she
conversed with Ben Elias, who seemed to be the unofficial leader of their
class. He knew this situation couldn't last much longer.
"Next week is going to be interesting," he mumbled to himself, well
aware that the balance of power in their class was on the verge of shifting.
Mia's presence was like a ticking time bomb for Ben's influence in the class.
Her desire to lead was evident, and Charlotte also had aspirations to lead.
After seeing how efficient Class 1A was, they all felt the need for a clear
leader. It’s only a matter of time before we’ll have to choose.
They were outside the Central Building after returning their tablets to their
classrooms. Most students would have gone off to enjoy the campus
facilities, but a lot of them were still lingering.
"They're waiting for Ben, huh? Maybe planning to celebrate together?"
John whispered with indifference.
Ben was the central figure in the class, thanks to his strong and likable
personality. It wasn't a mystery why most of his classmates preferred group
activities with him instead of solo fun.
John couldn't help but notice that some of Mia Olivia's friends were also
hanging out with Ben's group. It was clear that Ben's charisma had won him
many allies, but John considered if that was all there was to it.
Did Mia send them to spy on him? Maybe. If she doesn’t keep an eye on
him, he could become a threat. Given the circumstances, many of his
supposed allies could also switch to Mia's side.
Amidst the uncertainty, Charlotte's position was unclear because she had
allowed Ben to take credit for their successful plan. However, nothing had
changed in the current situation.
"Nowhere to go but up," John nodded with a sense of relief as he
noticed Charlotte and Ben's conversation coming to an end.
From observing their interaction, it was clear that Ben was likely expressing
his gratitude to Charlotte for her contribution, which had ultimately led to

their class' victory. The smiles on their faces indicated that the conversation
was friendly.
He probably also asked her how she got to know the identities of the
imposters. Charlotte, of course, would choose to keep it to herself, and Ben
would respect that. After all, he would do the same in her situation. John
thought as he observed them shake hands and wish each other a happy
weekend.
Once the two parted, John watched Ben join his circle of friends, and
Charlotte waved excitedly at him. He, of course, returned the gesture almost
instantly.
What now? He wondered to himself.
John pondered his next move. There were several possibilities after the
Class Exercise. They could go their separate ways, and John could head
home early. It wouldn't be a bad idea, as he had plenty of things to occupy
his time.
However, that wasn't his preferred outcome.
"Hey, John. Would you mind coming with me somewhere?" Charlotte
asked, trying to sound casual, though her slight nervousness was evident.
John noticed that her eyes briefly drifted, and she hugged her arms,
showing signs of unease. There was tension in her facial expressions and a
subtle change in her voice pitch. While he couldn't be sure, John thought his
guess was probably accurate.
"Sure, where did you have in mind?" He replied, pretending not to have
noticed anything. He did this out of consideration, thinking that if she
wanted him to know, she would tell him.
At that moment, a heavy silence filled the air, strengthening John's
suspicion about Charlotte's distress. Her anxious demeanor and distant gaze
revealed the inner turmoil she was going through.
"Mr. Archibald's office," she finally said, her voice hinting at a mix of
anxiety and determination.
"Oh? Why?"

"It's about the cameras you mentioned yesterday," Charlotte replied, but
her gaze continued to wander as if she were considering how to proceed.
John chose to stay silent, observing her with his perceptive eyes. Will you
finally tell me what’s bothering you? He wondered to himself. Maybe I can
help…
"John... I... I don't know where to start, but I think it's time I told you
something I should have mentioned a while ago," Charlotte said. Her
expression made it clear she was conflicted, appearing both very worried
and trying to gather the courage to speak.
John realized that Charlotte needed some support to find the right words, so
he decided to step in.
"What's going on, Charlotte? You can talk to me."
As she looked at him with uncertain eyes, John felt a pang in his heart.
Waiting in suspense was torture, but he remained patient. If she didn't want
to share, there was nothing he could do, but he made sure to maintain a kind
expression to reassure her and give her the encouragement she needed to
open up.
It’s ultimately her choice, but as her friend, I should do what I can to ease
the process.
After all, friends were always there for each other, weren’t they?
"It's... it's about something that's been bothering me for a while,"
Charlotte began but then paused. She appeared to struggle with finding the
right words, so John decided to assist her.
"Is it related to why you changed your seat?"
"Huh...? Yeah, it is. You're really perceptive, John." She managed a
small smile before her expression turned dark again. Whatever this secret
was, it seemed to be tormenting Charlotte. Her eyes darted around, and
worry creased her brow.
Is she worried someone might hear us, or see us? Charlotte, who…? He
rarely saw her on edge, and it pained him to see her so distressed.
Saying anything more would be a distraction—noise that would prevent her
from making a sound judgment. John wanted to avoid that as much as

possible. Whatever Charlotte wanted to say, he wanted her to speak of her
own free will. In the end, you should do what you feel is right. You shouldn’t
feel pressured to talk.
"I... I have a stalker, John. And it's serious," she finally admitted, her
voice trembling, eyes filled with tears, face flushed with embarrassment and
fear.
John witnessed how Charlotte, once so confident, now broke down before
him. She seemed vulnerable and fragile.
His bright blue eyes widened as he heard her trembling confession.
"Like you said, friends shouldn't keep secrets from each other," she
stuttered, tears in her eyes as she drew nearer to him. She placed her hands
on his shoulders, gazing intently into his eyes. A strained smile played on
her face, despite her tear-stained cheeks, and she nodded gently.
She was finally ready to share everything.
“Don’t freak out, okay? Just listen. I'll tell you everything." In response
to her words, John nodded, still unable to speak. He gently placed his hand
on hers and smiled.
"Okay, Charlotte," he whispered, his gaze unwavering. "You can talk to
me."
Charlotte stood in front of John, her determined violet eyes shimmering
with tears that threatened to spill. The weight of her troubling revelation
hung heavy in the air as she finally gathered the courage to open up.
"It all started on Tuesday," she began, her voice trembling with fear. "I
got a message from the stalker when I got home. He… he’s blackmailing
me with something. I don't know what to do. For the past few days, I've
been living in fear. He's been taking pictures of me from my seat, so I had
to change it. I'm sorry for involving you, but I was terrified and desperate. I
don't know how it got this complicated. He even has audio recordings of
me, showering and talking to myself in my room. It's like he's everywhere."
John didn't know what to say as he listened. Maybe it was better to remain
silent. Charlotte's teary eyes and reddened face left him speechless.

"I had to tell Mr. Archibald. Even though I didn't know who to trust at
school, I took a chance and confided in him. So far, it seems the stalker
doesn't know, but I'm scared, John. I need to understand how he managed to
take pictures of me from that garden. I need to know how he knows so
much about me. I... I'm lost, and it's just too much. It's all overwhelming. I
can't handle it anymore, John."
Charlotte, I... John struggled to gather his thoughts, searching for the right
words. Too many thoughts swirled in his mind, but he couldn't find the right
ones. He was unable to think clearly at that moment.
All he could do was watch as his dear friend poured her heart out to him,
breaking down in front of him.
"If I hadn't met you, if you hadn't given up your seat, I don't know what
I would have done. You saved me from that nightmare, John. Your
kindness, your smile, your silly jokes, and your comforting words... They
helped me forget the fear that haunts me every night, every day. It's ironic,
but I feel so lonely, even though I always feel like I'm being watched.
Without you, John, I don't know..."
Before she could say more, John moved closer and hugged Charlotte.
Without hesitation, she hugged him back, and they stayed in that
comforting position as she let out the tears she had been holding back for so
long.
Their hearts melted, and John could hardly feel the warm tears falling on
his shoulder, but he could hear Charlotte's sobs. As he listened to her cry, he
felt a surge of emotions within him.
What kind of person would do this to someone? If they were watching this
now, how would they feel? Seeing a girl break down due to their actions.
This stalker was utterly despicable.
Despite the many words he wanted to say to comfort his friend and the
emotions swirling inside him, John decided it was best to stay silent and let
Charlotte cry it out.
"Thank you. Thank you so much, John. You're... you're the only friend I
can rely on now. Please... please don't leave me too."

The more she sobbed, the more he felt her trembling. Despite her tight grip
on him and her desperate pleas, his smile remained calm and gentle.
Charlotte, you've suffered enough...
"I'll never leave you," he whispered as he gently stroked her back.
"We're friends."
______________________________________

I… I just told him everything! Charlotte's heart raced as she remained in his
comforting embrace. She didn't believe she could do it, but she had just
shared everything about the nightmares and painful memories caused by the
stalker's actions.
Many times, she had considered staying silent, but John's encouragement
and kind words kept her going. It was as if he knew exactly what to say and
do.
He didn't pity her, something she didn't want. Instead, he showed empathy
and understanding, making her feel safe and heard. His reassuring smile and
soothing words helped her release her pent-up emotions, and he stayed with
her through it all.
She had no idea how long her emotional breakdown had lasted, but he had
been there every step of the way. His comforting words had given her
strength until she could finally stop crying and look into his eyes.
"I'm sorry I can't tell you about my past now, John. I just..." Charlotte
sniffled, but seeing his genuine smile brought her a sense of peace.
"It's okay, Charlotte. I understand, truly. You've already shown so much
strength by sharing this with me. You've said more than enough. I'm
honestly amazed by your bravery," he said kindly, his voice reassuring.
Charlotte felt a warm feeling when John used her name. "Thank you, John.
I'll share more with you one day, but right now, I don't want to dwell on
those memories. I don't want to relive the experience."
"I understand. Thank you for trusting me with this, Charlotte. And don't
worry, I'm here to support you in any way I can. We'll work together to
catch this person," he reassured.

"No, no! There's no need for that."
Charlotte closed her eyes, picturing John walking her home, joining her for
lunch, and engaging in their usual conversations. "Just knowing you're with
me is enough."
I feel much better now. A small smile finally appeared on her face as some
of the burdens inside her lightened.
But John's puzzled tone interrupted her blissful thoughts.
"What do you mean? Don't we need to catch the stalker? Or... oh, I see. Is
that why we're going to see Mr. Archibald?"
"Yes, we're going to check the garden's security camera," Charlotte
replied. "We should be able to spot the stalker on the garden camera. I
thought you would point that out.”
“Oh wow. I actually didn’t think of that.”
“Honestly, I wouldn't have thought of it without your help. Thanks."
Charlotte said, and her smile widened as the weight on her heart lifted even
more.
"Is Mr. Matthias already aware of this?"
"Yeah, I emailed him yesterday, and he said he'll review the footage,
especially from the past few days when the stalker might have taken
pictures of me." John's eyes widened as he listened.
Is he surprised? Charlotte wondered.
“That’s impressive.” He said, rubbing his chin. He seemed to be in deep
thoughts, sort of reasoning how it would all work out.
As expected of John.
“I actually saw some gardeners in the garden yesterday. Do you think
they had anything to do with the stalker investigation?” Now, it was
Charlotte’s turn for deep thoughts.
“I’m not sure. I don’t think so. He has known about it for some time, so
its possible he did some investigation on the garden in my absence. But, I
only informed him of the camera stuff yesterday night, and he told me he
would go through them.”

“Shouldn’t he have gone through them already? At least, if he was
running the investigation on the garden itself. It also seems far-fetched that
they would use gardeners and not simply security staff to investigate the
garden.”
“Exactly.”
"I guess I was overthinking it. You're right," John said, rubbing his head
with a somewhat sheepish laugh.
Well, even geniuses make mistakes, Charlotte thought to herself and smiled.
John was undoubtedly brilliant, with a remarkable ability to decipher clues
and solve problems. Charlotte admired that about him. However, she also
realized that even with his brilliance, he wasn't infallible.
This time, he fell for an extreme conjecture, a logical fallacy. There was
also the non sequitur. He is trying to connect coincidences that seem to fit
the narrative into our conversation. Though, upon further thought, it just
doesn’t make sense.
He was going a bit too far in searching for connections. I'm surprised,
though. John made a mistake. Am I getting more observant, or is he simply
more human than I thought? Charlotte wondered with a grin.
Nonetheless, he was still incredible.
The realization of John's imperfection came at the right time, especially
after the intense class exercise. It prevented Charlotte from setting
unrealistic expectations of John.
In the end, he's just like all of us here—brilliant, but still human.
"Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go see Mr. Archibald. Hopefully,
he has some good news for you," John said, his cheerful smile bringing
Charlotte back to the present.
She nodded in response, and together, they headed toward their teacher's
office. As they left, Charlotte couldn't help but steal one final glance at
John.
"Yeah, let's go," she said with determination, knowing they would face
whatever challenges lay ahead as a team.
I have John with me now. It’ll be alright.

______________________________________

"I'm sorry, but I haven't found anything yet."
Charlotte and John exchanged puzzled glances when their homeroom
teacher gave them an unexpected answer.
Mr. Archibald appeared genuinely troubled, and his expression reflected the
frustration of the situation. Despite his diligent search through hours of
security footage for any sign of the stalker taking those unsettling pictures,
he hadn't found anything substantial.
"I might have missed something, with all the video content to sort
through—maybe even more than three days' worth. It'll take more time to
be sure, but for now... nothing. I'm sorry," Mr. Archibald said, with a hint of
disappointment.
Charlotte nervously bit her lip, but John reassured her with a hopeful and
sympathetic smile. Their close friendship was evident, and even Mr.
Matthias couldn't help but soften a bit as he witnessed it.
For him, there was nothing more frustrating than letting his students down.
He was determined to find the stalker and protect Charlotte, but she insisted
on keeping it a secret until they could narrow down the list of suspects.
Frankly, setting up an elaborate investigation board would make things
much easier and faster. This person had not only breached their tight
security but also threatened the safety of one of the Academy's students. It
was a matter that demanded the full attention of the school.
Her worries were valid, but time was running out, and the situation could
easily spiral out of control.
"We need more help to solve this," Mr. Archibald said, his frustration
evident due to their limited resources. "But I understand why you want to
keep it under wraps."
Because Charlotte insisted on keeping the incident a secret, only a few
people, including him, knew about it. They wanted to maintain
confidentiality until they could narrow down the list of suspects. It’s only a
matter of time before this situation gets out of hand. For now, though, let’s
take it slow. I already have some countermeasures in place. Just in case…

"Maybe the stalker used a different camera and edited the picture to
make it seem like it was taken in the garden," John suggested.
"Well, I suppose, but..." Matthias wasn't entirely convinced that this was
a more plausible scenario. Still, with limited options, it made sense to
explore other possibilities.
Charlotte considered John's idea. "If that's true, the stalker could have taken
pictures of me from anywhere at any time. This makes the whole situation
even more complicated," she realized, grasping the gravity of it.
Are we going with this now? Matthias couldn't believe how quickly
Charlotte had embraced John's idea, especially since it was a significant
departure from their initial assumptions. But there was something else that
surprised him.
How did these two become so close? For someone who wants to keep this
whole thing under wraps, it's surprising that she already told someone.
Charlotte's trust in John and her willingness to consider his suggestion was
remarkable. It left Matthias in awe. However, it was ultimately Charlotte's
choice. The academy valued student autonomy, which was why they were
involved in discussing the stalker issue rather than leaving it entirely to the
school.
It was also the reason they respected Charlotte’s stance on limiting the
investigation.
This affects her the most, after all. We need to be cautious in handling this
situation. Maybe considering John's suggestion could be more useful in the
long run. Still, Matthias had some concerns even if he tried to entertain such
a far-fetched idea.
"Charlotte showed me the pictures and videos, and I used a special
program to check for any alterations. It found nothing," Matthias explained.
He also mentioned the incidents where the stalker had recorded Charlotte in
her room. Considering these factors, it made sense to assume that the
stalker had to be somewhat close to her, making the idea of remote
photography seem less likely.
Moreover, they hadn't exhausted their efforts in reviewing the security
camera footage. If they continued to monitor it closely, they were bound to

find something valuable.
"You're right; it does sound a bit far-fetched and opens the door to a lot
of guesses. If we go with my idea, it might even broaden the list of suspects
without progress," John sighed, showing some regret for sharing his
thoughts. As an educator, Matthias couldn't overlook this.
"You did well by speaking up. I'll consider your suggestion as a possible
explanation. There are programs that can bypass the Image Detector AI,
anyway. Besides, you were just trying to help. So, feel free to contribute,
alright?" Matthias reassured him.
John's face softened, and he nodded. Charlotte even gave him a friendly
nudge, making both students smile sheepishly.
What good kids. Honestly, these two… Matthias was pleased to see them
cheer up, given the grim situation. He was getting tired of searching for
evidence with no results.
"Speaking of which... I was also thinking about the stalker's methods,"
John continued.
Both Charlotte and Matthias turned their attention back to John. They were
curious, though Matthias was a bit skeptical, considering their limitations.
"A computer virus. What if the stalker is using a virus?" John proposed.
"What?" Charlotte and Matthias exclaimed at the same time, their faces
showing surprise. The atmosphere grew awkward, as John had once again
introduced a far-fetched idea.
"Think about it. First, the stalker sent you some videos, and the next
day, he recorded your conversations. What if there's a connection between
those two events? It's possible for someone to download viruses hidden in
files. Maybe that virus affected your device, allowing the stalker remote
access," John explained.
Both Matthias and Charlotte were left speechless. John's theory was
strange, but it had the potential to answer many questions.
"This could explain how he could contact the people he threatened you
with, as he'd have access to your information. This person might be a
hacker, which would also enable them to produce altered photos and videos

without detection. They could gain access to your phone, laptop, or any
device you used to open those files," John elaborated.
The room fell silent, tension in the air. John could feel the weight of their
stares, filled with curiosity and concern. They all had sweaty foreheads, a
sign of anxiety. The implications of John's theory were sinking in, and it left
them feeling uneasy.
"No way. If that's true, then all my files... no way," Charlotte
stammered, her voice trembling. She appeared horrified as she stared off
into space, her face going pale.
"It's just a hunch, but we can run a thorough antivirus check on your
phone. Our school's security system is top-notch, designed to protect
sensitive information. If anything's fishy, it should catch it," John suggested.
Mr. Archibald narrowed his eyes and asked, "What makes you so sure?"
"Well, think about it," John replied. "This is one of the best schools
globally, right? A dream school for many. Since the school relies heavily on
information, it's vital to have strong defense mechanisms to safeguard its
assets. That's why I believe the school's antivirus will spot anything
suspicious."
Mr. Matthias was genuinely impressed, realizing that John's unconventional
ideas might have some validity. ‘I'm impressed by how much he's able to
figure out. His ideas might seem far-fetched, but maybe I should consider
his earlier suggestion as well. The more I think about it, the more it fits,’ he
thought to himself.
After thinking for a while, Mr. Matthias finally gave in. He sighed heavily
and looked at the visibly shaken Charlotte with concern. "Charlotte, do you
have your phone with you?" he asked gently.
"Y-yeah. It's right here," Charlotte replied, her voice still shaky.
"Alright, John, let's test your theory," Mr. Archibald said.
Without wasting any time, he connected Charlotte's phone to his laptop,
which was equipped with the school's advanced antivirus system. The
tension in the room mounted as everyone anxiously waited for the results.
What will it be? I wonder…

______________________________________

It was truly shocking!
Matthias Archibald couldn't believe the astonishing results on his laptop.
After a thorough scan, they discovered the single virus that had been
causing all the trouble on Charlotte's device. Just as John had predicted, it
was an extremely dangerous type, the kind they had hoped not to find.
"John was right all along. It's a Remote Access Trojan," Matthias
exclaimed, his eyes wide with concern. "It allows someone to control an
infected computer from a distance. The stalker used it to manipulate your
phone without your knowledge."
Charlotte's face turned pale, and she was visibly frightened, with sweat
streaming down her forehead. Her lips trembled as she uttered soft,
indecipherable whispers. It was clear that she was terrified.
"The stalker must have overheard everything we discussed here. He
knows who I've told. He's going to follow through on his promise. I... I
shouldn't have said anything. I shouldn't have—" Charlotte's voice broke,
and she seemed on the verge of tears.
"Charlotte, you need to calm down!" Matthias' voice rose, a rare display
of emotion from him. Yet, the urgency of the situation demanded that
Charlotte shake off her hysteria.
"I know you're scared right now, and I understand. This has gone
beyond what I predicted. However, we can't lose hope just yet. Remember
what you told me when we first talked about this."
Charlotte's face softened, and John gave her a comforting pat on the
shoulder, offering a reassuring smile. Returning the gesture, Charlotte
looked back at Mr. Matthias.
"You told me you wanted this guy to regret what he's doing. That's what
we need to focus on," Mr. Matthias said, trying to maintain hope in the
tense situation. They had been in the dark, but now they were one step
closer to the truth.
If they didn't give up, perhaps...

"The stalker is probably after something. Threatening to expose you is
their only real ammunition here. Once they use it, it’s game over for them.”
John added.
“He’s right. The stalker won’t use their only leverage that easily.” Mr.
Matthias nodded slowly.
“For now, we'll have to wait until he contacts you again," John continued.
"While we gather more information, try to buy some time."
Charlotte held back her tears and nodded in response to John's words and
her teacher's advice. Matthias thought to himself, ‘You’re impressive John.
Is this what it means to be a genius?’ as he returned Charlotte's phone to
her.
"You also opened the media on your laptop, right? That means it's
infected too. Don't worry, my antivirus has already removed the Trojan
from your phone, so you won't have any issues with that anymore. As for
your laptop, bring it to me on Monday, and I'll help you take care of it."
"What about her school tablet? Do we need to worry about that too?"
John asked, still concerned.
"No, we don't. It uses the same protection system as my laptop, so it
should be safe from infection. Just to be cautious, don't download any
media from this guy anymore. And be sure to contact me the moment he
texts you. With the virus gone from your phone, he won't be able to monitor
your activities," Matthias reassured her, keeping a close eye on Charlotte to
ensure she was okay.
"You should also keep your laptop powered off and remove the battery.
We don't want the hacker to spy on you through it," John added, echoing his
teacher's concern.
Despite the heaviness of the situation, Charlotte found comfort in their
unwavering support and genuine concern. Their care seemed to lift her
spirits from the emotional low she had been experiencing.
"T-thank you, both of you," she said, her grateful smile brightening up
the room, putting them all at ease.
She's such a good person. Charlotte's genuine kindness touched Mr.
Matthias deeply, fueling his disdain for the stalker's actions. Someone like

her should never have to endure this torment.
He glanced at John, who was returning Charlotte's radiant smile with one of
his own. Surely, John also recognized that someone as kind as her shouldn't
have to go through something so distressing.
That's why we need to catch this stalker.
Mr. Matthias let out a sigh and closed his eyes. The new variables that John
had introduced meant they had much to consider. Hopefully, this wouldn't
lead to another dead end.
______________________________________

John and Charlotte left Mr. Matthias' office, their minds buzzing with plans
for what came next. Although Charlotte still felt a hint of tension, John's
comforting presence as they walked down the nearly empty hallway put her
at ease.
As they made their way down the hallway, three men strolled in from the
entrance, engrossed in their own conversation. They passed by without
either group paying much attention to the other. There was no pause or
backward glance; they continued on their respective paths.
Charlotte thought she heard a door open and close behind her, but she didn't
pay it much attention. It was probably just the group of men arriving at their
destination. Teachers, maybe? Or staff. Her focus quickly returned to her
conversation with John.
"You know what? I won't let this get to me. Nothing's going to ruin
today, especially after acing that class exercise!" Charlotte clenched her fist
with determination.
Whether it was a genuine act or not, she was resolved not to let their recent
discovery bring her down.
“You should relax. Take it easy,” John suggested, his words
accompanied by an awkward laugh.
Charlotte thought to herself with a smile, ‘What a sweetheart. Is he still
worried about me?’ It was remarkable how close they had become in such a
short time, and Charlotte felt like she had known John forever.

"Oh, I'm definitely taking it easy. Once I'm back in my dorm, I'm going
to have a long shower, feast on some good food, and sleep like a boss!"
Charlotte playfully mimicked John's classic over-dramatic pose, making her
declaration with enthusiasm.
"Hahaha! Well played," John applauded, but there was something
hollow in his laughter.
Charlotte wondered, ‘Hold on, did I do it wrong?’
They finally exited the hallway, making their way to the gate while casting
passing glances at the dreaded garden. Who would have thought that it
would turn out to be a dead end? All their speculations and suspicions had
been in vain.
"I still can't believe what you said back there, John. You're incredible!"
Charlotte beamed at him.
John chuckled lightly, though his gaze seemed somewhat distracted. "I just
did what I could. You shouldn't overestimate my abilities."
Is he just being modest? Doesn't he realize how intelligent he is? Charlotte
couldn't believe that John would simply fake modesty, but that's how it
seemed.
Regardless, she wasn't having any of it.
"You're a genius, John. I don't think I've ever met anyone like you."
"Aren't we all geniuses? That's why we're here."
"No! You're different, John. You're special."
Upon hearing Charlotte's words, John stiffened and came to a sudden halt
beside her. His eyes widened, and he appeared to be focusing on something
far beyond what was in front of him. John's expression went completely
blank, as though he was in a daze.
"John? Are you okay? Is it something I said?" Charlotte asked, her
concern evident.
"I-I don't know. It's just that... my father probably wouldn't agree with
you," John admitted with a sad smile. "He would never call me special."

John's tone sounded somber and hollow, and Charlotte couldn't help but
wonder if he was okay. She thought, ‘Probably not. I can't believe his dad
wouldn't acknowledge him. That sounds awful.’
"He probably didn't know the real you, John. You should believe in
yourself more!" Charlotte tried to cheer him up, pumping her fists and
beaming with encouragement. "You should cheer up, John. You're really
awesome!"
"My grandfather says the same thing. What are the odds," John chuckled
faintly, giving a small semblance of a smile. "Thanks, Charlotte. Those
words mean a lot to me."
"You care about your grandfather a lot, don't you?"
Charlotte sensed something she had never seen John display before –
vulnerability. His eyes were downcast, and his lips were tightly pressed
together.
"Y-yeah… I do. He's my family," John replied calmly.
"Glad you feel that way," Charlotte replied warmly, giving him a kind
smile.
"Thanks, Charlotte. I really appreciate it," John said, picking up his
pace to match hers again. "I'm sure Grandfather will be glad I made a friend
like you."
"I should be thanking you, John," Charlotte blurted out quickly.
"For what?" John asked, curious.
John remained oblivious to her inner thoughts. Charlotte had initially
regarded him as just one of her many classmates, and her perception of his
character had evolved from suspicion to recognition. She no longer
remembered her initial apprehension of John.
I don't know what I would do without you. You've helped me more than I
can say. And, I promise... I'll repay all of this. Her smile deepened as she
gazed into his blue eyes.
"Just for everything, John. As I said before, you're a good friend."
"Oh, haha... thanks. You're a good friend too, Charlotte. No, the best,"
John flashed her a genuine, heartwarming smile.

"Come on, don't flatter me."
"I'm not. Really! You're the best." He laughed along.
"What if I said I think you're the best?" Charlotte quickly retorted,
playing along.
"So... we both think each other is the best? That's logically
impossible. There can only be one best," John playfully challenged.
In response, Charlotte brightened her smile and prepared herself.
"Are you sure? I think there's an exception to that." She stretched out
her hand, which had formed into a fist. A bright smile was plastered on her
face, and her heart raced with excitement as she made her statement.
"Best friends!" Her voice filled the air.
"…”
An unexpected silence took over.
“H-huh…?” John's puzzled expression made the big reveal a bit
awkward, but Charlotte couldn't give up at that point.
“I meant two people can be best friends... so technically, it's
possible..."
"O-ohhh!" John's eyes seemed to nearly pop out of his head after a few
seconds of silence. "I've never heard of that before. Good one! Wow! I
never even thought... whoa... I just learned something new today, all thanks
to you. Haha... that's an interesting thing you did there," he exclaimed, his
enthusiasm genuine.
Charlotte thought John's reaction might be a bit over-the-top, but seeing
how happy he was made her feel accomplished. "You're right, Charlotte. It's
not logically impossible."
‘Of course not, but that isn't even the point, John. I can't believe he can also
be this dense,’ Charlotte chuckled inwardly, but she joined him in laughter,
albeit a bit awkwardly. Well, there's no need to push it further. He'll get it
eventually...
After laughing and talking for a bit more, with John escorting her to her
dorm, both of them finally said their goodbyes. Charlotte made her way to

her room, and John walked home.
Even though they were separated, both of them continued to think of each
other as they went their separate ways. Whether or not they were thinking
the same thing didn't matter much to Charlotte.
She knew what she felt about John and how her day had gone thanks to
him.
Today... was amazing!

EPILOGUE
As a young boy strolls through the fields, he takes in the beauty of the
morning landscape and listens to the gentle rustling of leaves in the breeze.
He can sense all these sensations filling his mind, but they all boil down to
one thing.
NOISE!
Moment after moment, one layer after another, sound after sound, the
information just keeps coming. It never stops.
The once breathtaking view of the grand academy for the elite is slowly
losing its charm. The scent of the flowers, once so delightful, now seems
dull. Even the gentle caress of the wind feels the same.
Everything around him blurs together, all of it just noise.
"Today had its moments," the boy tells himself, trying to convince his
restless mind that he is not disappointed. The events were straightforward,
and it was essentially a confirmation of things he already knew. There
wasn't much novelty or excitement.
"Well, there was one thing," he reminds himself, trying to find a silver
lining, "I got to experience my first inter-class competition." He focuses on
the positives to justify his smile, ignoring the trivial details.
"It'll probably get tougher as we go on. I'm pretty sure about that," he
reassures himself, hoping not to be proven wrong as has happened many
times before.
As he passes through the school gates and enters the bustling streets, he
keeps his expression neutral, trying to filter out distractions. However, even
his peripheral vision bombards him with more irrelevant information,
adding to the noise in his thoughts.
He walks with measured steps, his concentration unbroken. Despite the
numerous distractions surrounding him and the cacophony within, the boy's
expression remains the same.
Sporting an innocent smile and a gentle gaze, he proceeds on his path. To
onlookers, he appears no different from a typical high school student on a

Saturday morning. The Island's residents have grown accustomed to this
sight. They know well the demanding nature of life at the Richardson Elite
Academy and their tight schedules.
Some of the passersby see the boy's smile and assume he's in good spirits.
They interpret his confident stride as a sign of smooth classes and mistake
his pleasant demeanor for satisfaction.
They are all mistaken.
I’ve succeeded on the Charlotte front. She sees me as her best friend now.
That’s satisfactory. It would've been disappointing if it turned out otherwise
after everything.
The charade, as he likes to call it, is reaching its final act. There is no longer
a need for Anonymous.
The boy's smile widens as the wind ruffles his dark hair. His blue eyes
remain fixed on the path ahead while his senses absorb the surrounding
noise. To drown out the present, he drifts into the past.
He remembers the day he visited the store after his first day of school,
gathering tools for his little project. It was surprisingly easy to disguise a
camera as a flower. He recalls maneuvering through the garden, replacing a
real hibiscus with a fake one, angling the camera just right to capture his
target without suspicion.
But there's more to it.
He reminisces about sending the first message to Charlotte, her initial
reaction, and planting the virus in the media he sent via email. With
flawless execution, he gained access to all her devices.
He managed to avoid raising her suspicions by using an AI chat-based
algorithm he developed. This allowed him to engage in conversation with
her while maintaining a presence in class, ensuring she wouldn't suspect
him. He also recalls the clever way he disposed of his camera once it had
served its purpose.
In the end, he created the problems and offered the solutions, remaining the
mastermind behind the scheme and the guide through it, just as he intended
from the beginning.

What drove him to these actions, one might wonder. The same force that
propels him forward now.
"It was necessary," he whispers to himself. "Not only did I get the seat I
wanted, I also earned Charlotte's trust. We're going to enjoy our time
together, and I can't wait for her to become the Class Representative."
These are his spoken words, but what does he truly think? What are his
thoughts on these actions?
I was wrong. I know that very well. I am sorry, Charlotte. Despite the
impression you have of me, I can't help but wonder what you'll think when
you discover…
The boy wonders if he feels guilt, or perhaps a sense of wrong.
In the end, this was the most beneficial choice.
Not only have I gained access to Charlotte, who is well-suited to lead our
class, but I was also able to delay the progress of our class, so the imposter
won’t have any useful information to give 1A—unlike the other way around.
This is all simply scratching the surface.
How do I justify this? What path should I take? The end justifies the means,
I suppose. Utilitarianism, hmm? Yes, that works well in this context.
In the end, this action of his—while causing a good deal of harm to one
person—yields greater benefits for the group as a whole. Even Charlotte,
his dear friend, would soon be better off thanks to this incident.
The moment he applies this rationale, the boy’s guilt evaporates.
I wonder, though… why her words keep echoing in my head. Despite all the
noise, why does it keep resurfacing?
"I'm a good person? I…" Those words from her feel like a complete lie in
light of his current self, a product of the illusion she lives in.
As a rush of memories floods in, they're so vivid that they seem as real as
the present. Many more lies and half-truths fill his memory, and he begins
to ponder, "Am I really a good person?"
No, that answer doesn't satisfy him.
He wonders if he'll ever find one that does.

His father tried. His grandfather tried. And now, Charlotte tried and failed.
This boy, surrounded by noise yet all alone, wonders if he'll ever discover
what he seeks.
‘I've been called many things by many people,’ John Lenard thinks, raising
his head to gaze at the sky, his thoughts racing amidst the overlapping
noise. Some have called me a masterpiece, others, a monster.
He lowers his head as he takes a deep breath, closing his eyes and blocking
his ears.
The noise comes to a halt for a moment.
Time seems to freeze, and John feels nothing around him.
He's immersed in silence and enjoys the brief solitude.
I just want to know who I am.

[TO BE CONTINUED…]

Afterword
To you, dear reader, who are reading this afterword, nice to meet you. I’m
the author, Magecrafter.
This book is something I’ve had in mind for over a year now, so I’m happy
I finally got around to publishing it. Thank you very much for buying it.
I’ve written quite a few novels on the Web (feel free to google my name and
check the books out), but none of my other books are like this one.
The story generally revolves around the protagonist, John. I don’t know
how you felt when reading this book, but my vision for the character has
always been to make him an enigma.
Who is John? What exactly goes on in his mind at every moment? Why
does he do what he does?
These questions are what drives the story, and I plan on peeling through his
layers as each volume comes out. If you didn’t like him in the first volume,
fret not.
Give it time.
Of course, other characters are important too, and they all have their arcs
that will run its course through the story. I’m actually pretty excited for all
this.
A-ahem… in any case, this is it. I have nothing more to say, so I’ll move on
to my acknowledgments:
To the editor I gave so much trouble to, Mercy, and to Blacklapiz, who
provided the amazingly beautiful illustrations: I’d like to give my special
thanks.

And to Lolade, who helped me out in every stage as my consultant and
friend, I couldn’t have come this far without you. Thank you!
Furthermore, I want to thank the beta-readers who read and gave me their
impressions of the initial draft. I was able to improve on a lot of things
thanks to you.
To my writing mentor, TimVic, and my dear friends; Teni, Faith, Vida,
Daniel (PF), Pelumi, Ruka, Cephas, Fabian, Ojus (and everyone else I
didn’t mention), who aided me on this writing journey… Arigatō
Gozaimasu.
I also want to thank my parents and dear siblings. Y’all are the best!
Finally, a thank-you to everyone who bought this book. I really hope you
find it to be a fun read.
Also, I have already started Volume 2, and I hope to publish it as soon as I
can. So please, stick around!
This ended up being longer than I expected, so I think I’ll stop here. If you
read this and thought I didn’t acknowledge you, then feel free to tell me
that.
I will do better in the next volume.
Once again, thank you so much! I hope you’ll continue reading.
Cheers!

Profile
Author Profile____________________Magecrafter

After reading tons of Light Novels, and writing novels on the Web for over
two years, this young man had a dream. To officially publish a book!
His personal favorite novels include: Overlord, Eminence In Shadow, and
Classroom Of The Elite.
The last novel is a given, especially considering how much inspiration was
drawn from it to make this book you’re currently reading.
Even though he is a struggling law student in a certain “University of First
Choice,” he decided to risk it all and write this book.
Was it worth it? Well… you tell me.

Illustrator Profile____________________Blacklapiz
Suddenly plunged into the world of illustration when studying accounting,
she didn’t know that she would work 20/7 days. When she was a kid, she
dreamed of becoming a mangaka but has become a webtoonist now. Even
though she has dark circles under her eyes, she works with a happy heart.

Afterword: The most satisfying is to draw the interactions between John
and Charlotte. I love their friendship. I hope the author doesn’t hurt them
much lol.

MANY QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED…

Who is the mastermind behind the ‘fake name incident’, and what
are their motives?
How will Year 1B overcome its internal crisis and band under a
single leader; and who will it be?!
What kind of person is this new student transferred from the rival
class? Where will his loyalties lie?
What will blossom from the internal and external rivalry of Years
1A and 1B?
And finally…
WHO EXACTLY IS JOHN? AND WHAT PLANS DOES HE
HAVE IN STORE FOR THOSE AROUND HIM?
FIND OUT IN THE NEXT VOLUME: [VOL. 2]
